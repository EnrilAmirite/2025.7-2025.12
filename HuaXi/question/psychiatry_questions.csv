Which of the following is not a feature of atypical depression?,"(a) TCAs are better than MAO and SSRI for treatmentRef: Complete review of psychiatry by Dr. Prashant Agrawal, ed., 2018, ch - 3, pg. 60Atypical depression as a biologically distinct subtype of depression has been suggested by its superior response to MAOIs compared to TCAs and from cerebral laterality, as well from genetic and neuroendocrine studies. (CTP 10th Eds, ICD10,DSM-V)Criteria for atypical depression* According to the DSM-V, symptoms of depression with atypical features include the following:A. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to positive events)B. Two or more of the following features, present for most of the time, for at least two weeks:1. Increased appetite2. Increased sleep3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)4. Interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) resulting in significant social or occupational impairmentC. Criteria are not met for melancholic(ENDOGENOUS/BIOLOGICAL) or catatonic features of depression.So Atypical depression can be defined as a subgroup of Depression (DSM5,ICD-10) the main criterion of atypical depression is the presence of mood reactivity in combination with at least two of four secondary criteria (hypersomnia, increased appetite or weight gain, leaden paralysis, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity).Note: The chief complaint of fatigue as part of the symptom of leaden paralysis in people with atypical depression can also result in misdiagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. That is why patients with no physical signs and symptoms (like tender lymph nodes, sore throat) but with history of long-standing fatigue should be carefully screened for presence of atypical depression.Other importent feature of ATYPICAL DEPRESSION are (compared to the patients with non-atypical depression)1. Female gender2. Earlier age of onset3. Longer disease duration4. More depressive recurrences5. More chronic disease course6. More suicidality7. More severe symptoms8. More comorbid diagnoses - dysthymia, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, panic disorder and social phobia9. Verbal fluency and psychomotor speed tasks seem to to differentiate atypical subtype of depression from melancholic subtype, since melancholic patients performed worst.10.

(The use of panic- inducing substances is strictly limited to research settings; no clinically indicated reasons exist to stimulate panic attacks in patients.) So-called respiratory panic-inducing substances cause respiratory stimulation and a shift in the acid-base balance. These substances include carbon dioxide (5 to 35 percent mixtures), sodium lactate, and bicarbonate.* Neurochemical panic-inducing substances that act through specific neurotransmitter systems include yohimbine, an I^+-2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; m-chlorophenyl piperazine (mCPP), an agent with multiple serotonergic effects; m-Caroline drugs; GABAB receptor inverse agonists; flumazenil (Romazicon), a GABAB receptor antagonist; cholecystokinin; and caffeine. Isoproterenol (Isuprel) is also a panic-inducing substance, although its mechanism of action in inducing panic attacks is poorly understood.* The respiratory panic-inducing substances may act initially at the peripheral cardiovascular baroreceptors and relay their signal by vagal afferents to the nucleus tractus solitarii and then on to the nucleus paragigantocellularis of the medulla.* The hyperventilation in panic disorder patients may be caused by a hypersensitive suffocation alarm system whereby increasing PCO2 and brain lactate concentrations prematurely activate a physiological asphyxia monitor.* The neurochemical panic-inducing substances are presumed to primarily affect the noradrenergic, serotonergic, and GABA receptors of the CNS directly.",4,Serotonin,CCK,Glutamate,GABA,Psychiatry,Mood Disorders,41d29caf-dc2e-4bdc-b88f-dcdeefcaace0,single

significance of punishment in behaviour management was given by,"Behavioral therapy is learning given by BF Skinner , according to him all behaviors are learned phenomenon and thus can be unlearned Positive reinforcement a type of reinforcement when a behavior is rewarded there is more chance that the behavior is repeated Negative reinforcement is that when a behavior is done and an aversive response is removed, the behavior is repeated. When I go and meet my girlfriend, she checks my messages and picks up fight (aversive response) suddenly I delete all messages one day and that day there was no fight (no aversive response) then that behavior is repeated (delete all messages before meeting my girlfriend) Extinction is the type of reinforcement where a behavior is done and a rewarding response is removed the chance is that behavior will not be repeated A child likes to play with children( reward) but when the child fights with other children( undesirable behavior) the child will be removed from playing( removing a reward) , then the child stops fighting with other children( reduction of undesirable behaviour) Ref. kaplon and sadock synopsis, 11 th edition, pg no. 845",3,lorenz,schneider,skinner,bleuler,Psychiatry,Treatment in psychiatry,ef39671e-7cc0-4024-b56d-15eb85476c5a,single

Pavlov's experiment is an example of -,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Classical conditioning Classical conditioningo In classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (which usually does not produce the response), when paired with unconditioned stimulus (stimulus which usually produces a response), directly produces a response.o The typical example of classical conditioning is pavlov's experiment. Normally food produces salivation in dog, Therefore salivation in response to food is called unconditioned response and the stimulus, i.e., food is called unconditioned stimulus. Under normal circumstances, a dog does not salivate at the sound of a bell. However, if the sound of bell is paired consistently with presentation of food, the dog begans to salivate to the sound of bell even if the food is not presented. This learned response, i.e., salivation to a sound of bell without food, is called conditioned response and the stimulus (sound of a bell) is called conditioned stimulus.o There is a reverse side to classical conditioning, called counter conditioning. This amounts to reducing the intensity of conditioned response (e.g., anxiety) by establishing an incompatible response (e.g., relaxation) to a conditioned stimulus (i.e., snake). So anxiety symptoms can be reduced when the stimuli to anxiety are presented in graded order and systemically paired with a relaxation response. This process of reciprocal inhibition is called systemic desensitization.o Other behavioral therapies based on classical conditioning principle (counter conditioning) are exposure with response prevention and aversion therapy.",2,Operant conditioning,Classical conditioning,Learned helplessness,Modeling,Psychiatry,Cognitive and Behavior Therapy,2b56ba1f-6fef-40fa-9550-60482f9a137a,single

A 32-yrs-old woman is diagnosed with major depression. What is the chance that her identical twin sister will develop the same disease?,"Twin studies are useful tools to separate biological and environmental etiologic factors in illnesses. Most twin studies sta with the selection of monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs who are raised together, in which one of the twins has the disorder. The other twin is then followed to determine if he or she also develops the disorder. The propoion of the twin pairs in which both twins are affected is called concordance. The difference in the concordance rate between the monozygotic and the dizygotic pairs reflects the impoance of hereditary factors in the development of the disorder. The concordance rate for mood disorders in monozygotic twins averages 70% when various studies are combined. The concordance rate in Dizygotic twins is approximately 20%. This is significantly higher than that found in the general population, but still 2 to 4 times lower than the concordance in monozygotic twins. These studies prove that, although environmental factors do play a role in mood disorders (the concordance is not 100%), heredity has a major role.

Disruption or disorganisation of biological rhythm is observed in,"Ans. c (Depression) (Harrison's medicine 17th ed., Chapter 386)ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DEPRESSION# Although evidence for genetic transmission of unipolar depression is not as strong as in bipolar disorder, monozygotic twins have a higher concordance rate (46%) than dizygotic siblings (20%), with little support for any effect of a shared family environment. There is some evidence that a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (5- HTT) gene may interact with stressful life events to markedly increase risk of depression and suicide. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies show decreased metabolic activity in the caudate nuclei and frontal lobes in depressed patients that returns to normal with recovery. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies show comparable changes in blood flow.# Postmortem examination of brains of suicide victims indicate altered noradrenergic activity.# Diurnal variations in symptom severity and alterations in circadian rhythmicity of a number of neurochemical and neurohumoral factors suggest that biologic differences may be secondary to a primary defect in regulation of biologic rhythms.

"A 40-year-old man is brought to you by his friends. Apparently, he has ingested some unknown medication in a suicide attempt. The patient is disoriented to time. His temperature is 103 F, BP is 120/85 pulse 100/min and irregular, and respirations are 22/min. The skin is flushed and dry. Dilated pupils and muscle twitching are also noted on examination. ECG reveals prolonged QRS complexes. Hepatic transaminases are normal, and ABG shows a normal pH. These findings are most likely due to intoxication by which substance?","This patient's clinical picture is consistent with intoxication with tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and imipramine. Toxic effects are mediated by peripheral anticholinergic activity and ""quinidine-like"" action. The anticholinergic effects include mydriasis, tachycardia, impaired sweating with flushed skin, dry mouth, constipation, and muscle twitching. Quinidine-like effects (due to block of sodium channels in the hea) result in cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In this setting, prolongation of the QRS complex is paicularly impoant in the diagnosis. QRS width is, in fact, an even more faithful parameter of drug toxicity than serum drug levels. In severe intoxication, patients will develop seizures, severe hypotension, and coma. Acetaminophen results in liver toxicity. Liver enzymes would be elevated. Alcohol intoxication manifests with respiratory depression, hypothermia, and coma. The manifestations of benzodiazepine intoxication are similar to alcohol inasmuch as central nervous system depression is common to both drugs. Thus, acute benzodiazepine intoxication produces stupor, coma, and respiratory depression. The sympatholytic propeies of clonidine explain the clinical symptoms of intoxication. Clonidine overdose causes bradycardia, hypotension, miosis, and respiratory depression. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors represent a second-line treatment for major depression. Overdose induces ataxia, excitement, hypeension, and tachycardia. Such reactions can be precipitated by concomitant ingestion of tyramine-containing foods.

"Along a pleasant stimulus, noxious stimuli are given in treatment of alcohol dependence or sexual disorder is which of the following type of behaviour therapy","Aversion TherapyAversion therapy is used for the treatment of conditions which are pleasant but felt undesirable by the patient, e.g. alcohol dependence, transvestism, ego-dystonic homosexuality, other sexual detions. The underlying principle is the pairing of the pleasant stimulus (such as alcohol) with an unpleasant response (such as brief electrical stimulus), so that even in absence of unpleasant response (after the therapy is over), the pleasant stimulus becomes unpleasant by association. The unpleasant aversion can be produced by electric stimulus (low voltage), drugs (such as apomorphine and disulfiram) or even by fantasy (when it is called as cove sensitization).
