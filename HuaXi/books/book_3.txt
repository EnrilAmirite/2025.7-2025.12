Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders
xvi

Introduction
The Eleventh Revision of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD-11) was approved by the Seventy-second World Health Assembly, comprising the 
health ministers of all World Health Organization (WHO) Member States, on 25 May 2019 (1). 
ICD-11 represents the first major, comprehensive revision of the ICD in nearly 30 years, and 
incorporates major advances in scientific evidence, best clinical practices and health information 
systems (2). The development and maintenance of international classification systems for health 
and the standardization of diagnostic procedures are core constitutional functions of WHO (3). 
By international treaty, WHO’s 194 Member States agree to use the ICD as the standard for 
the reporting of health information to WHO. The ICD is therefore the fundamental global 
framework for monitoring mortality and morbidity, epidemics and other threats to public health, 
and disease burden. Reporting of health statistics to WHO based on the new system began on 
1 January 2022 (4).
Member States also use the ICD for other important purposes related to health services – 
for example, to facilitate access to appropriate health care, as a basis for developing clinical 
guidelines and standards of practice, and to facilitate research into more effective prevention and 
treatment strategies. Moreover, the governments of Member States use the ICD as a part of the 
framework for defining their obligations to provide free or subsidized health-care services to their 
populations (5). That is, the diagnosis of a particular health condition typically confers eligibility 
to receive a specified range of health services. The implementation of the ICD in clinical systems 
is therefore extremely important because of the way it drives services, costs and outcomes.
This volume, Clinical descriptions and diagnostic requirements for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders (CDDR), is the culmination of over a decade of collaborative work 
that took place within the context of the overall development of ICD-11 (2). The development 
of the ICD-11 CDDR was led by the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, 
and constitutes the most broadly international, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative 
revision process ever implemented for a classification of mental disorders (6). The CDDR were 
planned, developed and field tested with the intent of providing mental health professionals, 
other health professionals, trainees and students with a comprehensive clinically useful guide 
to implementation of the ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders. The CDDR are meant to support the accurate and reliable identification of mental 
health problems as they present in people seeking care in different settings worldwide, based 
on the best available evidence. Timely and accurate diagnosis of mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders can reduce the enormous disease burden associated with these 
conditions (7), thereby advancing WHO’s objective of “the attainment by all peoples of the highest 
possible level of health” (3, p. 2).
The CDDR are an integral part of ICD-11, but they are distinct from the version used by Member 
States for statistical reporting of health information, which is referred to as the linearization for 
mortality and morbidity statistics (MMS) (8). The MMS contain brief descriptions (or definitions) 
that are meant to be used for statistical and health information purposes for most categories in 
ICD-11, including all categories in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders 
chapter. In contrast, the CDDR, which have been developed specifically for the ICD-11 mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter, provide substantially more detailed 
information needed by mental health and other health professionals to understand and apply this 
part of the classification in their work with patients.
Introduction

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

A brief history of the CDDR
ICD-6 (9) was the first version of the classification published by WHO, the first to contain 
a classification of morbidity as well as mortality, and the first to include a classification of mental 
disorders. In both ICD-6 and ICD-7 (10), the only information provided for mental disorders 
was the code number and name for each diagnostic category, along with inclusion terms, which 
specified some of the range of diagnostic concepts meant to be encompassed by the category. 
Starting with ICD-8 (11), the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use began to 
provide additional information to assist with clinical implementation. In 1974, the Department 
published a glossary of mental disorder terms and additional guidance related to the classification 
of mental disorders (12), indicating that “unless some attempt is made to encourage uniformity of 
usage of descriptive and diagnostic terms, very little meaning can be attributed to the diagnostic 
side of statistics of mental illness based on the ICD and in many other ways communication 
between psychiatrists will become increasingly difficult” (12, p. 12). Subsequently, brief definitions 
were also included in the main, statistical version of the classification for all categories in the 
mental disorders chapter in ICD-9 (13) and ICD-10 (14). (This innovation in the classification 
of mental disorders in ICD-9 and ICD-10 has now been applied across the entire ICD-11 so that 
the MMS contain brief descriptions for most categories in the classification.) However, according 
to the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use, these brief definitions were not 
recommended for use by mental health professionals but rather were intended for use in health 
statistics and in the coding of medical records and death certificates (15).
In 1992, the Department published a volume entitled The ICD-10 classification of mental and 
behavioural disorders: clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines (CDDG) (15) concurrently 
with the publication of the statistical version of ICD-10. The CDDG was “intended for general 
clinical, educational, and service use” (15, p. 1). For each disorder, a description of the main 
clinical and associated features was provided, followed by more operationalized diagnostic 
guidelines that were designed to assist mental health clinicians in making a valid diagnosis.
The CDDR for ICD-11 represent an important advance in providing comprehensive practical 
guidance on diagnosing mental disorders. A major improvement in the ICD-11 CDDR compared 
to the ICD-10 CDDG is the consistency of structure and information across major categories, 
based on reviews of the available evidence (16). The development of the CDDR has been guided 
by the principles of clinical utility and global applicability. The information included is intended 
to be useful to health professionals in making diagnostic judgements about individual patients, 
including the features they can expect to see in all cases of a given disorder and how to differentiate 
disorders from non-pathological expressions of human experience and from other disorders 
including medical conditions. The CDDR describe additional clinical features that may be 
present in some cases of a given disorder and provide key information that can assist in evaluating 
diagnoses across cultures, genders and the lifespan. More information about the specific contents 
and approach of the CDDR is provided in the next section on using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings. The reliability, clinical utility 
and global applicability of the CDDR have been confirmed through a comprehensive programme 
of developmental and evaluative field studies (6,17–19) that involved thousands of clinicians in all 
global regions. This research programme is described in more detail later in this chapter.
Intended users of the CDDR
The CDDR are designed to be used by mental health professionals who are authorized by 
training, scope of practice and applicable statute to provide diagnostic evaluations of people with 
mental disorders (e.g. psychiatrists, psychologists in some countries). They are also intended to 

be useful to non-specialist health professionals (e.g. primary care physicians, nurses), who in 
many countries provide a substantial proportion of total mental health services. They will also 
be useful for other professionals in clinical and non-clinical roles who need to understand the 
nature and symptoms of these disorders even if they do not personally diagnose them. Finally, the 
CDDR are intended to provide students and trainees in variety of mental health and other health 
fields with comprehensive guidance and information to support their development as competent 
diagnosticians or interdisciplinary team members.
It is important to note that the organization of ICD-11 into chapters is not intended to reflect 
the scope of practice of specific medical specialties or clinical professions. For example, mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders and diseases of the nervous system are in separate 
chapters, but WHO does not intend this as a statement that psychiatrists should not be allowed 
to assess and treat headache disorders or that neuropsychologists should not be permitted to 
evaluate which disease process may be causing a particular case of dementia given the pattern of 
symptoms. Similarly, certain mental disorders (e.g. neurocognitive disorders such as dementia 
or delirium, or dissociative disorders such as dissociative neurological symptom disorder 
or dissociative amnesia), frequently come to the attention of a variety of health professionals 
(e.g. primary care physicians, neurologists) who may be equipped to evaluate and diagnose them 
using the CDDR as a guide.
Health-care professionals using the CDDR to make diagnoses should be qualified to do so by 
their clinical training and experience, and are expected to have the necessary clinical expertise 
and understanding of mental disorders to identify symptoms and to distinguish disorders from 
normal variation, from one another, and from transient responses to stress or environmental 
circumstances. The CDDR are written to allow for the exercise of clinical judgement, and it is 
the diagnosing health professional who is responsible for developing a diagnostic formulation 
appropriate for an individual patient, considering the patient’s individual, social and cultural 
context as well as the characteristics of the health system. It is equally important to note that 
diagnostic classification is only a part of patient assessment. The CDDR are not a guide to patient 
care, nor a comprehensive textbook of psychiatry, nor a manual of how to conduct clinical 
assessments and differential diagnoses. The focus of the CDDR is on the classification of disorders 
and not the assessment and treatment of people, who are frequently characterized by multiple 
disorders and diverse needs (5).
Development of the MMS and the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
As noted above, the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use led the development 
of the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, including 
both the MMS and the CDDR. Over the course of more than a decade, the Department 
coordinated an intensive, systematic, international process that involved a wide range of key 
stakeholder groups including scientific and public health experts, clinicians, representatives of 
WHO Member States, scientific and professional societies, service users and their carers, and 
other nongovernmental organizations. All expert contributors to this document were asked to 
complete a WHO Declaration of Interests (DoI) form prior to their contribution. Once received, 
the WHO Secretariat reviewed the DoI forms and evaluated whether there were any conflicts of 
interest and, if so, whether these required a management plan. Prior to the finalization of this 
document, all contributors were asked to complete another DOI form. No conflicts of interest 
requiring a management plan were identified.
Introduction

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Formation of the ICD-11 International Advisory Group
In 2007, the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use appointed the International 
Advisory Group for the Revision of ICD-10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders (5), comprising 
scientific experts from all WHO regions and representatives from relevant international scientific 
societies. This Advisory Group was tasked with scientific oversight for the entire revision process. 
Its specific functions were to advise WHO on the key guiding principles and goals of the revision, 
the steps involved in the revision, and identification of other groups of relevant consultants and 
stakeholders required to develop the classification of mental disorders and other relevant parts 
of ICD-11; and to facilitate the implementation of global field studies to assess and improve the 
revisions to ICD-11 and the CDDR. The Advisory Group also functioned as one of approximately 
30 topic advisory groups for the overall development of ICD-11, each focusing on a different area 
or cross-cutting theme (e.g. gastroenterology, ophthalmology, quality and safety) and represented 
on the Revision Steering Committee – working with the WHO Classifications and Terminology 
and Data Standards Team responsible for coordinating the overall effort.
Development of the CDDR by ICD-11 working groups
The International Advisory Group advised the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance 
Use on the appointment of more than a dozen working groups tasked with reviewing the 
relevant evidence and making proposals for changes to the structure and content of the ICD-10 
classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Most of the working 
groups were established in relation to a particular subset of mental disorders (e.g. psychotic 
disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, personality disorders). Others were appointed to make 
proposals regarding how cross-cutting themes (e.g. presentations in children and adolescents, 
presentations in older adults, cultural factors) would be handled in the CDDR. Members of the 
working groups were expert multidisciplinary mental health professionals with relevant scientific 
and/or clinical expertise. The working groups were constituted such that experts from all WHO 
regions were included, with substantial representation from low- and middle-income countries.
The working groups’ charge included reviewing the extant body of basic science, clinical and public 
health research relevant to their area of responsibility for use as a basis for their recommendations 
for revisions to the classification of mental disorders in ICD-10. The working groups used these 
reviews to recommend changes to enhance the validity of ICD-11 (e.g. addition or deletion 
of categories, changes in thresholds or diagnostic requirements). They also reviewed available 
evidence related to the clinical utility of proposed changes, such as whether the revised diagnostic 
descriptions would enhance the identification of individuals who need mental health services or 
their usefulness in treatment and management decisions in a range of global health-care settings, 
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Working groups proposed specific changes to 
the structure of the classification of mental disorders in ICD-11; what categories and specifiers 
were included; and the MMS brief descriptions and the CDDR for the area under their purview. 
They were asked to provide the rationale, evidence base and expected impact on clinical utility of 
any proposed change via a structured, documented process (16).
Working groups were instructed to emphasize considerations of clinical utility and global 
applicability in developing their recommendations. Clinical utility is important because health 
classifications represent the interface between health encounters and health information. A system 
that does not provide clinically useful information at the level of the health encounter will not 
be faithfully implemented by clinicians. In that case, data aggregated from health encounters 
will not be optimal and perhaps not even valid, affecting the usefulness and validity of summary 
health encounter data used for decision-making at the health system, national and global level. 
The WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use operationalized the clinical utility 

of a category in the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders 
as depending on:
• its value in communicating (e.g. among practitioners, patients, families, administrators);
• its implementation characteristics in clinical practice, including its goodness of fit 
(i.e. accuracy of description), its ease of use and the time required to use it (i.e. feasibility); 
• and its usefulness in selecting interventions and in making clinical management decisions.
Global applicability was addressed via the diverse global membership of the working groups and 
by the international nature of the field studies implemented as part of the development of the 
CDDR, and by specific attention to culture as a part of the CDDR (see the sections on public 
review and field testing and on cultural factors below).
In order to generate relatively uniform information and a consistent structure across groupings 
and categories of the CDDR (see the next section on using the ICD-11 classification of mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings), working groups collated 
diagnostic information using a standardized template (referred to as a “content form”), with 
relevant references. This information served as source material for the development of the 
CDDR, with the final editorial responsibility vested in the WHO Department of Mental Health 
and Substance Use. The brief descriptions in the MMS and the more detailed essential features 
in the CDDR were developed together in order to be fully compatible, though designed for 
different purposes. The MMS brief descriptions are typically summaries of the essential features 
for the corresponding entity in the CDDR, although these brief descriptions alone do not provide 
sufficient information for implementation in clinical settings.
Public review and field testing
Proposals developed by working groups were described in the scientific literature (e.g. 20–26), 
made available for public review (27), and tested via a systematic programme of global field 
studies (see the section on field studies below). Scientific oversight for the field studies was 
provided by the ICD-11 Field Studies Coordination Group (FSCG) (28), comprising global 
leaders in clinical care, scientific research and public health representing all WHO regions, with 
substantial representation from low- and middle-income countries. FSCG members not only lent 
their technical expertise to the design, analysis and interpretation of the field studies but also 
served as essential facilitators by successfully engaging global clinicians to participate in ICD-11 
field studies around the world. Many of them directed international field study centres, which 
conducted field studies in routine clinical settings with real patients. The FSCG and relevant 
working groups were also involved in proposing changes to the CDDR based on the results of the 
field studies (17).
WHO’s comprehensive programme of field testing to assess the reliability, clinical utility and 
global applicability of the proposed CDDR was a major area of innovation, employing novel study 
designs and new methodologies for collecting information. Global participation was a defining 
characteristic of the ICD-11 CDDR field studies, which engaged multidisciplinary clinicians 
working in diverse contexts across the world, and were conducted in multiple languages. A key 
strength of the research programme was that studies were conducted within a time frame that 
allowed the results to be used as a basis for further revision of the CDDR prior to publication.
Early in the revision process, two major international, multilingual surveys were conducted – one 
of psychiatrists, conducted in collaboration with the World Psychiatric Association (29) and the 
other of psychologists, conducted in collaboration with the International Union of Psychological 
Science (30). These surveys focused on participants’ use of diagnostic classification systems in 
clinical practice, and the desirable characteristics of a classification of mental disorders. The 
professionals overwhelmingly preferred more flexible guidance to allow for cultural variation 
Introduction

and clinical judgement compared to a strict criteria-based approach, and were receptive to a 
system incorporating a dimensional component. Respondents described a number of categories 
as having poor clinical utility in practice, while others were recommended for addition or 
deletion (31,32). These data were used in the initial decisions about the content of the CDDR and 
in the development of diagnostic guidance by working groups.
In order to provide data to assist in developing an organizational structure that would be more 
clinically useful, two formative field studies were conducted to examine the conceptualizations 
held by mental health professionals around the world regarding the structure of mental disorders 
and the relationships among them (33,34). These data showed a high degree of similarity across 
countries, languages and regions, regardless of the classification system participants used in 
clinical practice, and informed decisions about the structure of the classification.
The proposed CDDR material was then tested in two main sets of evaluative field studies: 
case-controlled (internet-based) and ecological implementation (clinic-based) field studies. 
The case-controlled studies assessed the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic material; 
most compared how global clinicians applied the proposed ICD-11 material versus the ICD-10 
diagnostic guidelines for a given diagnostic area in terms of accuracy and consistency of clinicians’ 
diagnostic formulations, using a scientifically rigorous vignette-based methodology (17,35). 
Other studies examined scaling for diagnostic specifiers (36) and how clinicians actually used 
classifications in their clinical practice (37), including how they combined multiple dimensions 
in making a categorical diagnosis (38).
Case-controlled studies were conducted in between three and six languages – Chinese, English, 
French, Japanese, Spanish and Russian – per study, with participation from thousands of 
clinicians from across the globe who were members of WHO’s Global Clinical Practice Network. 
The Network’s field studies have assessed a wide range of disorder groupings (e.g. 39–45). 
Two internet-based studies comparing ICD-11 to ICD-10 were also conducted in German (46,47). 
Overall, these studies have demonstrated incrementally superior – or in some cases equivalent – 
performance of the ICD-11 CDDR compared to the ICD-10 CDDG in the accuracy of diagnoses 
assigned to case vignettes by participating clinicians, as well as improvements in ratings of clinical 
utility. When a clinician’s diagnoses did not follow the expected pattern, the study methodology 
allowed for examination of which specific features of the diagnostic requirements accounted for 
underperformance, which in turn permitted modifications to the CDDR to address points of 
ambiguity or misunderstanding (e.g. 39,44). These studies also included analyses of results by 
region and language to identify potential difficulties in global or cultural applicability, as well as 
problems in translation. In addition to refining the CDDR, data from these studies have provided 
useful information for the development of training programmes on the new ICD-11 diagnostic 
material. For example, the German study examining performance on a coding task suggested a 
substantial need for training initiatives to support the use of ICD-11 by professional coders (47).
Two major ecological implementation (clinic-based) field studies were conducted. The first 
tested the proposed CDDR diagnostic material when applied by practising clinicians to adult 
patients receiving care in the types of clinical settings in which the CDDR will be implemented 
(18,19). The study was conducted in 14 countries – Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, India, Italy, 
Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain and Tunisia – via a 
network of international field study centres. The study assessed the reliability and clinical utility 
of the CDDR for disorders that account for the highest percentage of global disease burden and 
use of mental health services in clinical settings among adults: schizophrenia and other psychotic 
disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically 
associated with stress. A joint-rater reliability methodology, in which two clinicians were present 
during the patient interview but reported their diagnostic formulation and clinical utility ratings 

independently, was employed in order to isolate the effects of the CDDR from other sources of 
variance in diagnosis (e.g. changes over time, inconstancy in reporting). Importantly, the level 
of training on the ICD-11 CDDR received by participating clinicians was similar to what might 
be expected in routine clinical setting during ICD-11 implementation. Clinicians were given no 
instructions on how to conduct their diagnostic interviews other than to assess the areas that 
were required as part of the study protocol. Overall, intraclass kappa coefficients (a measure of 
reliability between raters) for diagnoses weighted by site and study prevalence ranged from 0.45 
(dysthymic disorder) to 0.88 (social anxiety disorder). The reliability of the ICD-11 diagnostic 
requirements was superior to that previously reported for equivalent ICD-10 guidelines (18). 
Clinician ratings of the clinical utility of the ICD-11 CDDR were very positive overall. The 
CDDR were perceived as easy to use, accurately reflecting patients’ presentations (i.e. goodness 
of fit), clear and understandable, and no more time-consuming than the clinicians’ standard 
practice (19).
A separate study of common child and adolescent diagnoses was conducted in four countries – 
China, India, Japan and Mexico – with children and adolescents from 6 to 18 years of age (48). 
The study focused on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behaviour and dissocial 
disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders specifically associated 
with stress, using a design that was analogous to the adult study. Kappa estimates indicated 
substantial agreement for most categories, with moderate agreement for generalized anxiety 
disorder and adjustment disorder. No differences were found between younger (6–11 years) and 
older (12–18 years) age groups, or between outpatient and inpatient samples. Clinical utility 
ratings for these diagnoses were positive and consistent across the domains assessed, although 
they were somewhat lower for adjustment disorder. Taken together, the results of the ecological 
implementation studies supported the implementation of the ICD-11 CDDR in clinical settings, 
and suggested that the results of the case-controlled studies were generalizable to clinical settings. 
Another clinic-based field study in three countries examining the novel behavioural indicators 
for the assessment of the severity of ICD-11 disorders of intellectual development found them 
to have good to excellent levels of inter-rater reliability, concurrent validity and clinical utility. 
This supported their use to assist in the accurate identification of individuals with disorders 
of intellectual development, particularly in settings where specialized assessment services are 
unavailable (49).
A separate field studies programme to test the section of the ICD-11 CDDR on disorders due to 
substance use and addictive behaviours involved field testing centres in 11 countries: Australia, 
Brazil, China, France, Indonesia, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Malaysia, Mexico, Switzerland 
and Thailand. The main aim of the studies was to explore the public health and clinical utility, 
feasibility and stability (comparability with ICD-10) of the proposed CDDR for disorders due 
to the use of psychoactive substances, as well as the newly designated subgrouping of disorders 
due to addictive behaviours (i.e. gambling disorder and gaming disorder). The mixed-methods 
approach used in these studies included key informant surveys and interviews, focus groups 
and consensus conferences at each study site. Across sites, more than 1000 health professionals 
participated in the survey, more than 200 participants were involved in 30 focus groups organized 
at the study sites, and 42 identified national experts in the field reviewed the draft CDDR.
Overall, this section of ICD-11 was judged to be major step forward compared to ICD-10 in 
terms of its utility for meeting clinical and public health, and its feasibility for implementation. 
There was broad support for major innovations in this area. For disorders due to substance use, 
this included the expansion of substance classes to reflect evolving patterns in global psychoactive 
substance use (e.g. synthetic cannabinoids, MDMA1 or related drugs), the introduction of new 
categories to capture episodes of harmful substance use, and the inclusion of the concept of “harm 
to health of others” in the definition of harmful substance use (25). There was also support for 

 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamfetamine, also known as “ecstasy”.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

integrating disorders due to addictive behaviour in the same overarching grouping as disorders 
due to substance use, and for the introduction of the new diagnostic category gaming disorder. At 
the same time, the field study results highlighted the overall increase in complexity of this part of 
ICD-11 and the need for training of health professionals in order to ensure a smooth transition. 
The field studies also yielded specific suggestions for better delineation of the boundaries among 
some diagnostic categories as well as better descriptions of new ones.
In addition, WHO commissioned a study (50) on the concordance among diagnoses for alcohol 
and cannabis use disorders based on ICD-11, ICD-10 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, fourth and fifth editions (DSM-IV and DSM-5) (51,52). The results of 
the study demonstrated high concordance among the populations identified by the ICD-11 
diagnostic requirements compared to ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Concordance of between ICD-11 
and DSM-5 was substantially lower, in large part due to low agreement between the diagnoses of 
harmful pattern of alcohol use and harmful pattern of cannabis use in ICD-11 and mild alcohol 
use disorder and mild cannabis use disorder in DSM-5.
Development of the CDDR also included the involvement of mental health service users and 
carers through two studies in 15 countries representing diverse clinical contexts in multiple 
global regions (53,54). These studies constituted the first instance of a systematic research 
programme studying mental health service users’ perspectives during the revision of a major 
diagnostic classification system. The studies employed participatory research methodologies to 
systematically collate service user perspectives on key CDDR diagnoses that contribute to high 
disease burden, including schizophrenia, depressive episode, bipolar type I disorder, generalized 
anxiety disorder and personality disorder. Findings from these studies provided an understanding 
of how mental health service users respond to diagnostic content of the CDDR, and served 
as a basis for providing recommendations to WHO about potential enhancements of CDDR 
diagnostic material that may enhance its clinical utility (e.g. its usefulness in communicating 
with service users) and mitigating potential unintended negative consequences of the diagnostic 
material, including stigmatization of diagnosed individuals.
Coordination with the development of DSM-5
The development of ICD-11 overlapped with the development and publication of DSM-5 (52). 
The Chair and Co-Chair of the DSM-5 Task Force regularly attended meetings of the Advisory 
Group in an effort to facilitate “harmonization” of the two classifications. This was most successful 
in terms of the way that mental disorders are divided into groupings and how those groupings are 
ordered in the two classifications (referred to as the “metastructure”). In this regard, ICD-11 and 
DSM-5 are quite similar to one another, though not identical, and substantially different from ICD-
10 and DSM-IV. Most ICD-11 working groups included at least one member of the corresponding 
DSM-5 workgroup. ICD-11 working groups were asked to consider the clinical utility and global 
applicability of material being developed for DSM-5, with the goal of minimizing unintentional or 
arbitrary differences between the two systems. Intentional conceptual differences were permitted, 
however, and the working groups were asked to provide a justification for such differences where 
they were proposed. The differences between ICD-11 (both the MMS and the CDDR) and DSM-5 
are therefore conscious and intentional (16,55), and a number of such differences have stimulated 
valuable research that has enhanced our knowledge about psychopathology (56).

Key approaches to classifying mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders
The definition of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
The ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders begins with the 
following definition:
Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders are syndromes characterized by clinically 
significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation or behaviour that 
reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes that underlie 
mental and behavioural functioning. These disturbances are usually associated with distress 
or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas 
of functioning.
The term “disorder” is used as a part of nearly all category titles in the chapter. Although “disorder” 
is not a precise term, as in ICD-10 its use is intended “to avoid even greater problems inherent 
in the use of terms such as ‘disease’” (15, p. 11), which implies greater certainty about etiology 
and pathophysiology than exists for most mental disorders. Although mental disorders are by 
definition syndromes, “syndrome” is a broader term with more variable usage. Its use in category 
titles in the classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders is restricted 
to the grouping of secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and 
diseases classified elsewhere; these are conditions with more variable symptoms that are less 
specified in the CDDR, but are judged to be direct pathophysiological consequences of a medical 
condition. Other conditions referred to as syndromes that are mentioned in the CDDR are 
classified in other parts of ICD-11 (e.g. Tourette syndrome is included in the chapter on diseases 
of the nervous system).
Beyond the issue of terminology, the definition of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders helps to delineate two boundaries. The first is the boundary between mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders and diseases and disorders classified in other chapters of 
ICD-11, and the second is the boundary between mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders and normality. Both of these boundaries represent key issues in diagnosis. The first 
part of the definition (“clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional 
regulation or behaviour”) indicates that the essential features of the disorders included in the 
ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders invariably involve 
(but are not limited to) symptoms from these domains of mental and behavioural functioning. 
The presentation of disorders in other ICD-11 chapters (e.g. those on diseases of the nervous 
system and sleep-wake disorders) may include disturbances in these domains, but they are not 
common to all the disorders in those chapters.
The second part of the definition is intended to clarify that in order for a clinical presentation to be 
diagnosable as a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder (as opposed to representing 
normal variation), the symptom must reflect a dysfunction in an underlying psychological, 
biological or developmental process. For example, the experiences of an individual who has 
recently been bereaved might include acute feelings of sadness and emptiness accompanied 
by disturbances in cognition, emotional regulation or behaviour. However, symptoms entirely 
attributable to grief are not in and of themselves indicative of an underlying dysfunction in a 
psychological, biological or developmental process. Normal bereavement is not considered to be 
a disorder, despite its potential negative impact on social and occupational functioning. Similarly, 
behaviour (e.g. political, religious, sexual) that deviates from the accepted standards of society is 
only considered to be symptomatic of a mental disorder if it is a manifestation of a dysfunction in 
a psychological, biological or developmental process.
Introduction

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The final part of the definition (“these disturbances are usually associated with distress or 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning”) notes that distress in the individual and/or impairment in functioning is commonly 
a consequence of the symptoms, and for many mental disorders is an essential feature. At the 
same time, it is not always required (e.g. individuals experiencing a hypomanic episode in the 
context of bipolar type II disorder often do not experience distress about their condition, and 
by definition do not exhibit functional impairment), hence the use of “usually” in the definition.
Structure of the chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders
The organization of the ICD-10 chapter on mental and behavioural disorders had been dictated 
in part by the ICD-10 coding system itself. The first character of ICD-10 codes, which indicated 
the chapter, was alphabetical, thus allowing for up to 26 chapters. The second character, which 
indicated the diagnostic grouping within the chapter, was numerical, effectively limiting the 
number of possible diagnostic groupings within a chapter to 10. The use of alphanumeric characters 
throughout the ICD-11 coding system removes those artificial constraints. Consequently, there are 
21 diagnostic groupings in the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders. A few of the ICD-11 diagnostic groupings are completely parallel to ICD-10 groupings 
(e.g. disorders due to substance use, schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, mood 
disorders). Most of the other ICD-10 diagnostic groupings were split into multiple ICD-11 
groupings. For example, ICD-10 neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders was split into 
five ICD-11 diagnostic groupings: anxiety and fear-related disorders; obsessive-compulsive and 
related disorders; disorders specifically associated with stress; dissociative disorders; and bodily 
distress disorders.
In one case, three ICD-10 diagnostic groupings (mental retardation; disorders of psychological 
development; and behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood 
and adolescence) were combined into a single neurodevelopmental disorders grouping in ICD-11, 
although some of the disorders that were included in the behavioural and emotional disorders 
with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence grouping in ICD-10 were placed into 
other ICD-11 diagnostic groupings based on symptomatic presentations (e.g. conduct disorders 
were placed in the disruptive behaviours or dissocial disorders grouping in ICD-11). Disorders of 
intellectual development in ICD-11 have been reconceptualized from ICD-10 mental retardation 
such that they are assessed based on adaptive behaviour functioning in addition to intellectual 
functioning.
The elimination of ICD-10 diagnostic groupings explicitly linked to onset of the condition during 
childhood and adolescence is in part related to the decision to adopt a lifespan approach to the 
description of diagnostic categories in ICD-11. Each category contains a section on developmental 
presentations, which describes the manifestations of the disorder in early and middle childhood, 
adolescence and older adulthood, to the extent possible based on available evidence. The ICD-11 
CDDR also include descriptions of adult presentations of most disorders described exclusively in 
terms of children in the ICD-10 CDDG (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, separation 
anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, pica).
Four diagnostic subgroupings were moved out of the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders chapter entirely and placed within other ICD-11 chapters: ICD-10 nonorganic sleep 
disorders were moved to the ICD-11 chapter on sleep-wake disorders, ICD-10 sexual dysfunctions 
not caused by organic disorder or disease and gender identity disorders were moved to the 
ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health, and ICD-10 tic disorders were moved to 
the ICD-11 chapter on diseases of the nervous system. The movement of sleep-wake disorders 
and sexual dysfunctions to new, separate chapters in no way indicates that these conditions are 

not appropriately treated by mental health professionals. Rather, it reflects an effort to remove 
the artificial and scientifically and clinically inaccurate “mind–body split” embodied in the 
designation of “organic” and “nonorganic” forms of these disorders. The inclusion of ICD-11 
gender incongruence in the chapter on conditions related to sexual health reflects the conclusion 
that these conditions are not appropriately viewed as mental disorders based on a series of 
international field studies indicating that distress and functional impairment in transgender 
people is predicted by experiences of stigmatization and victimization rather than being an 
intrinsic characteristic of being transgender (57–59).
Categories and dimensions
ICD-10 was almost entirely categorical in nature (categories were either present or absent), with 
the only exceptions being severity-based subcategories for mental retardation (mild, moderate, 
severe, profound) and depressive episode (mild, moderate, severe). ICD-11 has moved beyond a 
strictly categorical approach, incorporating dimensional elements in two different ways. First, in 
addition to intellectual developmental disorder and depressive episode, bodily distress disorder, 
personality disorder and dementia are subcategorized based on severity (mild, moderate, severe). 
Second, a number of mental disorders allow for the indication of symptomatic manifestations 
that are intended to provide dimensional profiles that cut across different disorders in a 
particular grouping. These include symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders 
(positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depressive mood symptoms, manic mood symptoms, 
psychomotor symptoms, cognitive symptoms), which can be further coded as not present, mild, 
moderate or severe, and prominent personality trait domains in personality disorders (negative 
affectivity, detachment, asociality, disinhibition, anankastia). See the following section on using 
the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings 
for specific examples of how these dimensional specifiers are coded.
Cultural factors
Because the CDDR will be employed around the world as a basis for diagnosis and treatment 
selection among people living in diverse social milieus and cultural contexts, a key priority in 
development of the diagnostic material was to consider and reflect the influence of culture. 
Cultural factors affect the diagnosis of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders 
in complex and multifaceted ways. For example, culture can influence how disorders are 
conceptualized, experienced and expressed; what is considered normal or pathological; how 
functioning is affected; where and how people seek care; and the ways that patients and families 
participate in treatment. Attention to culture was also in line with the overall priority of the 
revision process to enhance the clinical utility and global applicability of the CDDR. Information 
that makes the diagnostic system more relevant and acceptable to clinicians and service users 
around the world can enhance the usefulness of the CDDR as tool for identifying those who 
require care and connecting them to services.
WHO appointed a Working Group on Cultural Considerations to develop material on culture 
for the CDDR. This Working Group conducted extensive consultations with experts from 
around the world, and systematically reviewed the literature on cultural influences on diagnosis 
and psychopathology for each diagnostic category, as well as relevant material on culture from 
ICD-10 and DSM-5. Information was also collated from materials produced by other ICD-11 
working groups as part of their generation of proposed content for their respective diagnostic areas.
On this basis, the Working Group developed a section entitled “culture-related features” for 
diagnostic categories in the CDDR. The focus was on providing pragmatic, actionable material 
to assist clinicians in using the CDDR to evaluate patients in a culturally informed manner and 
reduce bias in clinical decision-making. This section is meant to be of practical use in the process

of engagement, diagnosis, evaluation and treatment selection, and addresses the following areas:
• cultural variation in prevalence and symptoms of disorders;
• information about social contexts and sociocultural mechanisms that may account for this 
variation; and
• descriptions of cultural concepts of distress (e.g. idioms, causal explanations) that are relevant 
to diagnosis and treatment decisions, prioritizing cultural variations that may be associated 
with national or ethnocultural background (60,61).
The resulting guidance aims to assist the clinician in making informed decisions likely to foster 
more contextually applicable patient-centred care that is sensitive to the cultural and social milieu 
of the clinical encounter.
For example, the section on culture-related features of the CDDR for panic disorder indicates 
that the symptom presentation of panic attacks may vary across cultures, and describes several 
notable cultural concepts of distress that link panic, fear or anxiety to cultural attributions 
regarding specific social and environmental influences. Understanding these attributions can 
assist in differential diagnosis and can also clarify whether panic attacks should be considered 
expected or unexpected (as is required for a diagnosis of panic disorder) given the environmental 
circumstances.
The development of the CDDR incorporated cultural considerations in several other ways. First, 
global applicability of diagnostic material was identified early on as an overarching objective of the 
CDDR, and the development process was led and guided by experts and clinicians representing 
all major global areas. The Advisory Group, the FSCG and all working groups included members 
with diverse geographical and linguistic backgrounds, many of whom had direct experience 
working in low-resource contexts and within various cultures.
The design and implementation of ICD-11 field studies also adhered to the principle of enhancing 
the global and cultural applicability of the CDDR by engaging thousands of clinicians from around 
the world in a comprehensive research programme to assess the reliability, clinical utility and 
global applicability of the requirements. For example, the formative studies that helped to shape 
the architecture and linear structure of the CDDR involved clinicians from over 40 countries and 
were conducted in multiple languages. The evaluative case-controlled studies engaged clinicians 
in large-scale, multilingual studies related to major diagnostic areas of the CDDR. The clinicians 
who participated in the case-controlled studies were members of the Global Clinical Practice 
Network (62), which now includes more than 18  000 mental health professionals from over 
160 countries, and was established by WHO for the purposes of assisting in the development of 
ICD-11 by its members participating in internet-based field studies. Similarly, clinic-based field 
studies testing the implementation of the CDDR with real patients took place in over 25 study 
sites in 14 culturally, linguistically and geographically diverse countries. Hundreds of clinicians in 
these countries provided feedback directly on the CDDR to help enhance its reliability and utility 
in culturally diverse global settings.
Using the CDDR in research
In addition to the ICD-10 CDDG, the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use 
published The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: diagnostic criteria for 
research (DCR) (63) as a companion document. The DCR presented fully operationalized criteria 
for ICD-10 mental disorder entities, specifically intended for use in research. These criteria 
were designed to replace the “diagnostic guidelines” portion of the corresponding category in 
the CDDG, which tended to be more flexible and less fully operationalized. The core criteria-
based approach taken in the DCR was therefore much more compatible with the approach of 

DSM-IV (51), although substantial differences between the two systems remained (64). However, 
almost no research using the ICD-10 DCR appears to have been published.
The greater standardization and the provision of a broader and more systematic range of clinically 
relevant information in the ICD-11 CDDR compared to the ICD-10 CDDG (16) was designed 
to make the CDDR more useful in clinical decision-making, and therefore also in education 
and training. The extremely high ratings of the clinical utility of the CDDR, particularly in 
international clinic-based field studies with real patients (19,48) suggest that this objective was 
achieved. Moreover, the solid reliability results from the ICD-11 field studies (18,48) indicate that 
the CDDR would be satisfactory for use in certain kinds of research projects – for example, projects 
focused on individuals with particular diagnoses as these are assigned in health-care settings (e.g. 
patients diagnosed with recurrent depressive disorder receiving services at a particular facility).
However, in other types of research projects, in which obtaining reproducible and precise 
psychiatric diagnoses is more important, standardized diagnostic assessment procedures are 
necessary. This is meant to control variability inherent in diagnostic processes that rely on the 
interviewer’s diagnostic interviewing skills (different interviewers may ask different questions to 
assess the same clinical phenomena) and clinical judgement (different interviewers may arrive at 
different diagnostic conclusions). For example, studies of the efficacy of treatments for particular 
disorders require consistency in diagnostic procedures to ensure that the population being studied 
has been assigned the diagnosis for which the treatment is intended according to consistent and 
explicit diagnostic rules to reduce random diagnostic heterogeneity. Similarly, epidemiological 
studies that utilize lay (i.e. not clinically trained) interviewers to apply the ICD-11 CDDR require 
pre-scripted questions and strict decision rules because they cannot rely on the clinical expertise 
of the interviewer to make judgements about which features are present. For these reasons, several 
WHO-sponsored diagnostic instruments are being developed to facilitate the application of the 
ICD-11 CDDR in particular research settings.
The Structured Clinical Interview for ICD-11 (SCII-11) is a semi-structured diagnostic interview 
that requires experience in clinical interviewing on the part of the interviewer. The SCII-11 is 
designed to be used in conjunction with the CDDR, and provides a standardized set of questions 
to assist researchers to elicit the information needed to conduct a differential diagnosis in the 
context of research studies. It will also be useful for training purposes and in clinical settings.
The development of the SCII-11 required extensive decisions about operationalizing the CDDR 
so that they can be more reliably applied in research settings. The SCII-11 operationalized the 
CDDR in two different ways: by substituting more precise diagnostic thresholds and by the choice 
of wording of corresponding interview questions. The CDDR intentionally avoid artificially 
precise duration and symptom cutoffs, allowing clinicians more flexibility for clinical judgement. 
The SCII-11 modifies some of the CDDR items, substituting more precise thresholds. For 
example, the ICD-11 CDDR for panic disorder define a panic attack as follows: “Panic attacks are 
discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension also characterized by the rapid and concurrent 
onset of several characteristic symptoms. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, 
the following…” The SCII-11 has modified this item, substituting the word “several” with “at 
least three”. Similarly, the CDDR incorporate many broadly defined diagnostic constructs that 
could be assessed in different ways. Rather than relying on the interviewer to decide the best 
way to assess them, the SCII-11 operationalizes diagnostic constructs through the specificity 
and wording of corresponding interview questions. For example, the CDDR for schizophrenia 
require the presence of at least two items from a list of seven, most of the time for a period of 1 
month, with one of the seven being “persistent delusions (e.g. grandiose delusions, delusions of 
reference, persecutory delusions)”. Since there is no single question that can satisfactorily cover 
every type of delusion, the SCII-11 divides the assessment of delusions into separate questions 
corresponding to specific types of delusions (e.g. delusions of reference, persecutory delusions, 
Introduction

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

grandiose delusions, delusions of guilt, somatic delusions). Given that it is a semi-structured rather 
than a fully structured interview, the interviewing clinician also has the option of following up 
on particular responses or asking additional questions in order to assess the relevant phenomena 
fully. WHO plans to make available a list of the operational decisions implemented in the SCII-11 
as a resource in the development of other instruments to encourage greater cross-instrument 
agreement.
In addition, WHO is developing a fully structured diagnostic interview to be used in 
epidemiological studies and in other situations in which the SCII-11 is not feasible owing to 
time constraints or because it is not feasible to use trained clinicians as interviewers. The Flexible 
Interview for ICD-11 (FLII-11) covers common and high-burden mental disorders, but is less 
comprehensive than the SCII-11. It is based on the algorithms and operationalizations developed 
for the SCII-11 but consists entirely of closed-ended (primarily yes/no questions), and is designed 
for use by lay interviewers with a limited amount of training. It will also be available for electronic 
administration as an open-access tool for WHO member states.
The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) (65,66) is a semi-structured 
clinical interview used by trained clinicians to assess and diagnose mental disorders among 
adults, originally developed as a part of a joint project of WHO and the United States National 
Institute of Mental Health. The SCAN comprises a set of instruments, supported by manuals, 
and was originally developed around the Present State Examination, which assesses a wide range 
of symptoms likely to be manifested during a psychotic episode. The SCAN is designed to yield 
both ICD and DSM diagnoses, and has been translated into more than 35 languages. It requires 
extensive training by an approved training centre to administer. Its approach is different from 
that of the SCII-11, which attempts to assess the diagnostic requirements of mental disorders 
more directly via direct self-report of their essential features. Version 3 of the SCAN is currently 
being developed and will be fully compatible with the ICD-11. It will refer to the SCII-11 
operationalizations in the formulation of its diagnostic algorithms, although its assessment 
methodology will remain distinct.
In addition, instruments focused on particular diagnoses as formulated in ICD-11 are being 
developed by WHO as well as by researchers external to WHO. For example, WHO is supporting 
the development of screening and diagnostic tools for gaming disorder (67). Instruments not 
sponsored by WHO include several measures of personality disorder severity and trait domains 
based on ICD-11 developed by different research groups (68–71). A self-report measure of 
ICD-11 post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder has been 
validated (72) and translated into over 25 languages. A scale designed to assess ICD-11 compulsive 
sexual behaviour disorder has been developed and validated (73), and will be made available in 
up to 30 languages as part of a large international research project (74). Ultimately, the use of the 
ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in research will 
depend on the development of validated measures for specific purposes, as illustrated by these 
examples, rather than on the development of a separate classification intended for research use.

Conclusion
As stated by the Advisory Group early in the development of ICD-11, “People are only likely to have 
access to the most appropriate mental health services when the conditions that define eligibility 
and treatment selection are supported by a precise, valid, and clinically useful classification 
system” (5, p. 90). The ICD-11 classification of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders and the CDDR have taken major steps in this direction. As a part of the first major 
revision of the ICD in three decades, the new diagnostic classification for mental disorders and 
the CDDR were developed based on comprehensive reviews of available scientific evidence and 
best clinical practices, using a participative global, multidisciplinary and multilingual process. 
Clinical utility and global applicability were guiding principles of this work, which was closely 
linked to a systematic programme of field studies involving thousands of clinicians around 
the globe.
The overall ICD-11 represents an enormous step forward, being based on and designed to be 
fully integratable with electronic health information infrastructure, which dramatically expands 
the capacities and flexibility of the classification system. It is likely to be the standard for global 
health information for some time – perhaps as long or longer than was ICD-10. A key aspect 
of WHO’s plans regarding ICD-11 is that regular updates will occur every 2 years; these will 
provide an opportunity to modify the classification to reflect new knowledge and changing 
circumstances. It is anticipated that a greater number of changes will be made early on, as 
Member States gain experience in actually using the classification. This will provide an important 
mechanism for making refinements or clarifications to the classification of mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders should they be justified based on emerging evidence and 
clinical experience.

Introduction

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
Using the CDDR for ICD-11 
mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders 
in clinical settings
This chapter provides a basic orientation to applying the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings. As previously indicated, the CDDR are 
not intended to function as a manual for conducting clinical assessments. Rather, they are to be 
applied in the context of clinicians’ broader understanding of the disorders they are assessing 
and the clinical competencies they have gained through appropriate education, training and 
experience. This chapter also contains information on relevant aspects of diagnostic coding, some 
of which are the result of important innovations in how ICD-11 categories are represented and 
relate to one another. This material on coding relates to the entire ICD-11 and is not specific to 
the chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Coding is discussed here 
as it affects the implementation of the CDDR.
This chapter includes a discussion of the following issues:
• components of the CDDR;
• making an ICD-11 diagnosis using the CDDR;
• co-occurring and mutually exclusive diagnoses;
• other specified and unspecified categories;
• other ICD-11 chapters relevant to diagnostic formulation of mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders; and
• ICD-11 diagnostic coding.
Components of the CDDR
A major improvement in the ICD-11 CDDR compared to the ICD-10 CDDG is the consistency 
of structure and information across major categories. The information provided for the main 
disorder categories in the CDDR is organized under the following headings:
• Essential (required) features
• Additional clinical features
• Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Course features
• Developmental presentations
• Culture-related features
• Sex- and/or gender-related features
• Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis).
The information provided is based on reviews of the available evidence, and is intended to be 
useful in making diagnostic judgements about individual patients. These sections do not provide 
a summary of all available information about the topic in question, but rather focus on issues that 
may be specifically relevant to assigning a diagnosis to an individual patient. If a particular heading 
(e.g. developmental presentations, sex- and/or gender-related information) is not provided for a 
specific disorder, this is because insufficient evidence was identified as a basis for making clinically 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

relevant and broadly applicable statements. The following sections give a brief description of the 
information provided in each section of the CDDR for the main disorder categories.
Essential (required) features
This section provides guidance regarding the features needed to make the diagnosis confidently. 
The essential features represent those symptoms or characteristics that a clinician could reasonably 
expect to find in all cases of the disorder. In this sense, essential features resemble diagnostic 
criteria. However, artificial precision in diagnostic requirements, such as using exact counts of 
required symptoms and specific duration requirements as diagnostic cutoffs has generally been 
avoided unless these have been well established with appropriate global evidence. This allows 
for broader exercise of the professional’s clinical judgement, depending on the characteristics 
of the patient – including cultural variations in presentation – and local circumstances. For 
example, it makes little sense to impose a rigid duration requirement of 6 months for a patient 
who has been experiencing the required symptoms for 5 months if the current visit represents 
the only opportunity that the patient is likely to have for appropriate treatment for the next year. 
This flexibility in language also allows the clinician to differentially weigh symptoms that are 
particularly severe and impairing, and to consider culturally specific “idioms of distress” that may 
differ somewhat in the way the patient understands and describes their experience but represent 
the same underlying phenomenon (e.g. somatic expressions of psychological distress).
Additional clinical features
This section describes additional clinical features that are not diagnostically determinative but 
are associated with the disorder frequently enough that they can help the clinician to recognize 
variations in disorder presentation. This section is also used for alerting the clinician to the 
likelihood that certain clinically important associated symptoms or co-occurring disorders may 
be present and require assessment and treatment.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
This section provides guidance regarding the differentiation of the disorder from normal variation 
in characteristics that may be continuous with, or similar to, the essential features of the disorder. 
This section often specifies aspects of the disorder that are indicative of its pathological nature and 
describes typical false-positives (i.e. clinical presentations that are similar in certain respects but 
are considered to be non-pathological). For many disorders, the differentiation from normality is 
based on the presence of significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Course features
This section provides clinically relevant information regarding the typical course of the disorder, 
which is defined broadly to include information about age of onset, whether the disorder is 
persistent or episodic, its likely progression or remission over time, and its temporal relationship 
to life stressors and other disorders.
Developmental presentations
This section describes how symptom presentations may differ according to the individual’s 
developmental stage. Many disorders traditionally thought of as disorders of adulthood (e.g. 
depressive disorders) can present during childhood, and many disorders often thought of as 
disorders of childhood persist into adulthood, with alterations in their presentation. For example, 
presentations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in younger children often include 
excessive motor activity. In adolescents and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the 

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
equivalent phenomenon is experiencing feelings of physical restlessness or a sense of discomfort 
with being quiet or sitting still. Also included in this section are developmental variations that are 
more common in older adults, among whom many mental disorders are often underdiagnosed. 
This section also contains information about different patterns of co-occurring conditions and 
risks for associated sequelae according to developmental stage.
Culture-related features
This section provides information regarding cultural considerations that should be considered 
when making the diagnosis. This includes cultural variations in prevalence and symptoms of 
disorders, sociocultural mechanisms that may account for this variation, and descriptions of 
cultural concepts of distress that are relevant to diagnosis and treatment decisions. See the section 
on cultural factors in the Introduction for additional information.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
This section covers sex- and/or gender-related diagnostic issues, including sex- and/or gender-
linked differences in symptom presentation, community prevalence and presentation in 
clinical settings.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
This section lists other disorders that should be considered in the differential diagnosis – 
particularly those that share presenting symptoms or features. For each of these disorders, this 
section describes the features that differentiate it from the index disorder, providing guidance to 
the clinician about how to make this differentiation. Issues related to the concurrent diagnosis 
of the disorder being distinguished from the index disorder are also discussed in this section. 
The boundary descriptions generally cover all information conveyed by exclusion terms on the 
ICD-11 MMS platform.3 Exclusion terms are often confusing to clinicians because they assume 
that they mean that the excluded condition cannot be diagnosed simultaneously with the index 
condition, which is not the case. Rather, an exclusion term in the ICD-11 MMS indicates that the 
condition excluded is not part of the condition described by the category, so that both conditions 
may be used at the same time if warranted. These considerations are covered more clearly and 
explicitly in the boundary descriptions found in this section of the CDDR.
Making an ICD-11 diagnosis using the CDDR
Consideration of essential (required) features
The diagnostic process starts with a consideration of whether the presentation meets the 
diagnostic requirements laid out in the essential (required) features section of the CDDR for 
the diagnosis under consideration. There are two types of essential features: those that must 
be present for the diagnostic requirements to be met and those that require a consideration of 
whether the symptoms may be better explained by other mental disorders that share presenting 
features. This aspect of the diagnostic evaluation includes a consideration of:
• particular symptoms that must be present (which may be expressed as a minimum number 
of symptoms from an item list – e.g. “Several of the following symptoms must be present”);
• the minimum amount of time that symptoms need to have been present (e.g. “present…for 
a period of at least several months”);
• frequency or proportion of the time that symptoms need to be present during that required 
period of time (e.g. “most of the time”, “most of the day, nearly every day”, “for more days 
than not”, “more than 1 hour per day”, “multiple incidents”);

int/browse11/l-m/en#/).

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

• in some cases, whether the onset of symptoms meets a particular diagnostic requirement (e.g. 
“characterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms”); and
• whether the symptoms meet any stated requirement regarding their impact on the individual’s 
functioning (“symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning”) or have resulted in 
“significant distress”.
As noted, the CDDR generally avoid artificial precision in quantifying the exact number of items 
that must be present from a list of symptoms or specifying a precise duration requirement. Too 
rigidly applied, these can create barriers – for example, due to cultural variation or in contexts 
where an individual may have limited opportunities to access care. The essential features attempt 
to describe the relevant clinical phenomena clearly in order to allow for flexible application of 
the CDDR in establishing the presence of each diagnostic item. It is up to the diagnosing health 
professional to make a judgement about its presence or absence, considering the entire context 
of the clinical presentation. If the essential features do not mention a required duration for the 
symptoms, it is assumed that the symptoms should have been present for at least one month in 
order to assign the diagnosis. 
Consideration of other disorders that may share presenting features
This aspect of the diagnostic evaluation includes whether the symptoms are best considered 
to be a manifestation of a disease or disorder classified outside of the mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders chapter (e.g. a sleep-wake disorder, a disease of the nervous 
system, or another medical condition). In cases where the symptoms are judged to be a 
direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition and the mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental symptoms are a specific focus of clinical attention, a diagnosis of one of 
the secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere may be assigned, in addition to the appropriate diagnosis for the etiological medical 
condition. For example, depressive symptoms similar to those of a depressive episode that are 
judged to be due to hypothyroidism would warrant a diagnosis of secondary mood syndrome, with 
depressive symptoms in addition to hypothyroidism. However, certain disorders are diagnosed 
regardless of whether they are believed to be caused by a medical condition classified elsewhere, 
including neurocognitive disorders and certain neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e. disorders of 
intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder, stereotyped movement disorder).
The evaluation also includes whether the symptoms are due to the effects of a substance or 
medication on the central nervous system. If so, a diagnosis of one of the substance-induced 
mental disorders (e.g. alcohol-induced delirium, amfetamine-induced psychotic disorder) is 
likely to be appropriate. Other categories specifically linked to substances or medications include 
catatonia induced by substances or medications; amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances, 
including medications; and dementia due to psychoactive substances, including medications.
Finally, the diagnostic evaluation includes whether there are other ICD-11 mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders that share features with the disorder under consideration, 
that might better account for the symptomatic presentation. Whether a particular disorder that 
could account for the symptoms in fact better accounts for them is a clinical judgement. For 
example, the essential features of social anxiety disorder, which are characterized by marked and 
excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in social situations, includes the diagnostic requirement 
that “the symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia, 
body dysmorphic disorder, olfactory reference disorder)”. Each of these listed disorders may 
also involve the development of anxiety in social situations. For body dysmorphic disorder and 
olfactory reference disorder, the anxiety involves excessive self-consciousness about perceived 
defects in appearance or emitting an offensive body odour, respectively. In agoraphobia, the 

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
anxiety is related to a fear of specific negative outcomes in social situations, such as panic attacks 
or other incapacitating (e.g. falling) or embarrassing (e.g. incontinence) physical symptoms. In 
making the clinical judgement of whether the symptoms of anxiety in social situations are better 
accounted for by one of these other disorders, the clinician takes into account factors such as the 
temporal sequence of the symptoms, which symptoms predominate, and the presence of other 
clinical features.
Consideration of boundary with normality (threshold)
For the most part, mental disorders occur on a severity continuum with no sharp division 
separating cases and non-cases (i.e. normality), making the differentiation between a mild case 
of the disorder and non-disordered normal variation potentially challenging. It is advisable to 
review this section because, in some cases, what might appear to be evidence of psychopathology 
may in fact be within the bounds of normality given the individual’s developmental stage and 
cultural context. This section of the CDDR also points out common false-positive presentations.
Consideration of boundaries with other disorders and conditions 
(differential diagnosis)
This section of the CDDR is an extension and expansion of the “consideration of other 
disorders that may share presenting features” element of the essential features and provides 
a more comprehensive review of other disorders that should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis. The clinician should consider whether any of the disorders listed might explain the 
presenting symptoms.
Consideration of co-occurring and mutually exclusive diagnoses
ICD-11 diagnoses are generally assigned for every disorder for which the diagnostic requirements 
are met; that is, co-occurring diagnoses are typically permitted. However, there are specific 
situations in which the diagnostic requirements may be met for more than one disorder, typically 
because of symptom overlap, but the CDDR recommend making only a single diagnosis. In most 
cases, this is noted in the essential features but, in some cases, it is noted in the description of 
the differential diagnosis for that disorder in the section on boundaries with other disorders 
and conditions.
In the CDDR, recommendations against diagnosing two particular disorders together (i.e. co-
occurrence) are generally made in one of the following ways.
• “The symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for …”; “The symptoms do not 
occur exclusively during episodes of …”; “The individual has never met the diagnostic 
requirements for …”: these types of exclusionary statements are typically used if the 
symptomatic presentation of the disorder in question is already part of the definition of 
another disorder, and an additional diagnosis of the excluded disorder would be redundant.
• The first case (“symptoms do not meet diagnostic requirement for”) prevents the assignment 
of both diagnoses if the diagnostic requirements for both disorders are met at the same time, 
and generally indicates that the other disorder should be diagnosed instead. For example, 
the CDDR for bulimia nervosa indicate that the diagnosis should only be assigned if the 
symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa, so that individuals 
who maintain an excessively low body weight by reducing their energy intake through purging 
behaviour would be assigned only a single diagnosis of anorexia nervosa rather than diagnoses 
of both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The presence of bulimia-like behaviour is 
indicated with the binge-purge pattern specifier applied to the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

• The second case (“symptoms do not occur exclusively during episodes of”) similarly prevents 
diagnosing the disorder in question if its symptoms only occur during episodes of another 
disorder. For example, the CDDR for dissociative amnesia indicate that it should not be 
diagnosed if the dissociative memory loss occurs only during episodes of trance disorder; 
the amnestic symptoms are features of trance disorder rather than a separate condition.
• The third case (“individual has never met the diagnostic requirements for”) prevents 
a diagnosis from being made if there is currently, or a history of, another disorder. For 
example, the CDDR for schizotypal disorder indicate that, in order to assign the diagnosis, 
the individual’s past symptoms should never have met the diagnostic requirements 
for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder. Similarly, recurrent 
depressive disorder is not diagnosed if the individual has ever experienced a manic, mixed 
or hypomanic episode.
• “The symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder”: many essential 
features sections include the requirement that the symptomatic presentation is not better 
accounted for by another mental disorder. This is typically the case when the symptomatic 
requirements of one disorder are also a possible manifestation of another disorder. An 
example is the occurrence of significant anxiety symptoms that develop in anticipation of 
attending school. If the anxiety is entirely accounted for by fear of speaking in class and/or 
social interaction with peers, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder would be most appropriate. 
On the other hand, if the anxiety is entirely accounted for by fear of being separated from 
attachment figures while at school, a diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder would be 
appropriate. However, if the anxiety is related to both fear of negative evaluation by peers 
and separation from attachment figures, and all other diagnostic requirements for both 
disorders are met, then both diagnoses may be assigned. These distinctions typically require 
clinical judgement, in this example, about the relevant “focus of apprehension” or stimuli or 
situations that trigger the anxiety.
• Symptomatic presentations accounted for by another disorder can sometimes be assigned 
an additional diagnosis if the second diagnosis is a separate focus of clinical attention. 
Such recommendations may be noted in the section on boundaries with other disorders 
and conditions section. For example, stereotyped movements may be part of presentation 
of autism spectrum disorder: “repetitive and stereotyped motor movements, such as whole-
body movements…” are listed as examples of “persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible 
patterns of behaviour, interests or activities” in the essential features of autism spectrum 
disorder. In the boundary with stereotyped movement disorder in the CDDR for autism 
spectrum disorder, however, it is noted that “although such stereotyped movements are 
typical in autism spectrum disorder, if they are severe enough to require additional clinical 
attention – for example, because of self-injury – a co-occurring diagnosis of stereotyped 
movement disorder may be warranted”.
• Finally, the boundaries with other disorders and conditions section may contain other 
recommendations regarding whether or not to diagnose more than one disorder. For 
example, in the CDDR for generalized anxiety disorder, the boundary with depressive 
disorders states that “generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with depressive disorders, 
but should only be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder 
were met prior to the onset of or following complete remission of a depressive episode”.
Other specified and unspecified categories
By default, all groupings in ICD-11 contain what are called “residual categories”, which include 
“other specified” categories with ICD-11 codes ending in “Y” (e.g. 6C7Y  Other specified 
impulse control disorders) and “unspecified” categories with ICD-11 codes ending in “Z” (e.g. 
6A8Z  Mood disorder, unspecified). Occasionally, residual categories are “suppressed”, or not 
listed, in the ICD-11 MMS because the other categories contained in the grouping are considered 

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
to be exhaustive. For example, the grouping elimination disorders contains enuresis, encopresis 
and elimination disorder, unspecified; the other specified residual has been suppressed for this 
grouping and thus does not appear in the MMS.
The CDDR include essential (required) features for other specified categories at the grouping 
level (e.g. other specified mood disorder, other specified dissociative disorder). A particular other 
specified diagnosis should be applied when the presentation is judged to be a clinically significant 
mental disorder falling within a particular grouping of disorders (e.g. mood disorders, dissociative 
disorders) because it shares primary clinical features with these disorders but does not fulfil the 
diagnostic requirements of any of the other available categories. For example, a presentation that 
included all of the essential features of schizophrenia but had not met the 1-month duration 
requirement would appropriately be diagnosed as other specified primary psychotic disorder. 
A presentation characterized by abnormal eating or feeding behaviours that did not correspond to 
the essential features of any of the specific feeding and eating disorders categories but resulted in 
significant risk or damage to health, significant distress or significant impairment in functioning 
could be diagnosed as other specified feeding and eating disorder. Sometimes, other specified 
diagnoses may refer to recognizable syndromes that have not been included as separate categories 
in ICD-11 – for example, because they are very rare or are not sufficiently widely recognized 
as disorders. Ganser syndrome, for example, would be diagnosed as other specified dissociative 
disorder, and what is sometimes called “pathological demand avoidance” could be diagnosed 
as other specified disruptive behaviour or dissocial disorder if it did not meet the diagnostic 
requirements for oppositional defiant disorder. The characteristics of the presentation in other 
specified disorder should be specified in the clinical record.
Unspecified categories are most commonly used by professional coders when the clinician has 
provided insufficient information in the clinical record to assign a more specific diagnosis. 
In clinical situations, unspecified categories are appropriate only when insufficient information 
is available to make a more definitive diagnosis and, if possible, should be changed when 
additional information becomes available. In contrast to other specified categories, which are 
used when the clinician knows what the disorder is but there is no precisely corresponding code, 
unspecified categories are used when the clinician has been unable to arrive at a precise diagnostic 
determination. For example, an individual presenting in a hospital emergency department who 
is exhibiting hallucinations and delusions in the absence of evidence of substance use, delirium 
or dementia might be assigned a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorder, 
unspecified, until a more complete assessment can be conducted. Unspecified categories should 
not be used as an administrative shortcut when a more specific diagnosis can be assigned; this 
results in a major loss of clinical and statistical information.
Other ICD-11 chapters relevant to diagnostic formulation 
of mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
Categories from any of the other 24 chapters in ICD-11 may be comorbid with a mental, 
behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder, and thus relevant to their diagnostic formulation. 
However, the following chapters warrant particular attention:
Chapter 7. Sleep-wake disorders
The ICD-11 chapter on sleep-wake disorders brings together ICD-10 nonorganic sleep disorders 
(F51) with “organic” sleep disorders (G47) that were classified in the ICD-10 chapter on diseases 
of the nervous system, as well as categories previously included in several other chapters 
(i.e. endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases; diseases of the respiratory system; certain 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

conditions originating in the perinatal period). Sleep-wake disorders previously included in the 
ICD-10 chapter on mental and behavioural disorders include nightmare disorder, sleepwalking 
disorder, sleep terrors and “nonorganic” versions of insomnia disorders, hypersomnia disorders 
and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (disorders of the sleep-wake schedule in ICD-10).
The unified ICD-11 chapter on sleep-wake disorders reflects the fact that the pathophysiology 
of most of these disorders is complex and includes both physiological and psychological/
behavioural components. ICD-11 abandons outdated and incorrect assumptions about the 
etiology of sleep-wake disorders – in particular, the obsolete distinction between “organic” and 
“nonorganic” disorders. The chapter is intended to enhance patient care and public health by 
creating a more visible and accurate system that will enhance clinician awareness and improve 
diagnostic accuracy and treatment. Placement of these conditions in a separate chapter on sleep-
wake disorders is in no way intended to indicate that they should not be diagnosed and treated by 
appropriately trained mental health professionals.
Chapter 8. Diseases of the nervous system
Diseases of the nervous system have a close relationship with mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders. Disorders in both chapters may affect cognition, emotional 
regulation or behaviour, and reflect dysfunctions in the psychological, biological or developmental 
processes. Given that mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders also affect the brain, 
in some instances the distinction between the two chapters is arbitrary and reflects professional 
tradition – especially the boundary between psychiatry and neurology – as much as biological or 
phenomenological differences between the conditions listed in each.
For some conditions, the psychological, behavioural or developmental syndrome is classified 
in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter, while the underlying 
etiology may be classified in diseases of the nervous system. This includes disorders of 
intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder and stereotyped movement disorder in the 
neurodevelopmental disorders grouping; and delirium, mild neurocognitive disorder, amnestic 
disorder and dementia in the neurocognitive disorders grouping, all of which are diagnosed 
regardless of etiology. If the etiology is known, the corresponding diagnosis should also be assigned, 
which is often but not always in in the chapter on diseases of the nervous system. The other 
neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. developmental learning disorder, developmental speech or 
language disorder, developmental motor coordination disorder) are generally not diagnosed if the 
symptoms are fully accounted for by a disease of the nervous system. When mental, behavioural 
or neurodevelopmental syndromes are judged to be a direct pathological consequence of a 
disease of the nervous system and are a specific focus of clinical attention, a diagnosis from the 
grouping secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases 
classified elsewhere may be assigned. For example, a psychotic syndrome with prominent visual 
hallucinations that is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of Parkinson disease 
would be diagnosed as secondary psychotic syndrome, with hallucinations along with a diagnosis 
of Parkinson disease.
Tic disorders and acquired aphasia with epilepsy (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) were classified in 
ICD-10 as emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence, but in 
ICD-11 have been moved to the chapter on diseases of the nervous system. In addition, movement 
disorders caused by medications (e.g. drug-induced parkinsonism, drug-induced dystonia), 
which are associated with certain medications commonly used to treat mental disorders, are 
included among the diseases of the nervous system.

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
Chapter 16. Diseases of the genitourinary system
This chapter includes a grouping of premenstrual disturbances that may include significant mood 
symptoms, such as depressed mood and irritability, as well as somatic and cognitive symptoms 
that may also occur in mood disorders. In particular, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is 
secondary-parented in the mood disorders grouping of ICD-11, and the CDDR for this entity are 
provided in this volume. In addition, while nearly all sexual dysfunctions classified as diseases of 
the genitourinary system in ICD-10 have been moved to the new ICD-11 chapter on conditions 
related to sexual health (see the next section), pain syndromes that are more generally associated 
with genital organs or the menstrual cycle are classified in Chapter 16.
Chapter 17. Conditions related to sexual health
Analogously to sleep-wake disorders, the ICD-10 classification of sexual dysfunctions was based 
on a Cartesian separation of “organic” and “nonorganic” conditions. Sexual dysfunctions not 
caused by organic disorder or disease (F52), which also include “nonorganic” versions of the 
sexual pain disorders vaginismus and dyspareunia, were classified in the ICD-10 chapter on 
mental and behavioural disorders, and most “organic” sexual dysfunctions are classified in the 
chapter on diseases of the genitourinary system. These have been brought together in a new 
unified classification of sexual dysfunctions and sexual pain disorders in the ICD-11 chapter on 
conditions related to sexual health. This approach is consistent with current, more integrative 
clinical approaches in sexual health, and recognizes the large body of evidence that the origin 
and maintenance of sexual dysfunctions and sexual pain disorders most often involves the 
interaction of physiological and psychological/behavioural factors. Reformulated versions of all 
sexual dysfunctions from the ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders chapter can be found in 
the ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health, except for ICD-10 excessive sexual 
drive – a condition most closely related to compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in ICD-11 – 
which is included in the grouping of impulse control disorders. As with sleep-wake disorders, 
placement of these conditions in a separate chapter on conditions related to sexual health is 
not intended to indicate that they should not be diagnosed and treated by appropriately trained 
mental health professionals.
The ICD-11 chapter on conditions related to sexual health also includes gender incongruence, 
which represents a reformulation and renaming of ICD-10 gender identity disorders. There 
was substantial evidence that the nexus of stigmatization of transgender people and of mental 
disorders had contributed to a doubly burdensome situation for transgender and gender-variant 
people, and that stigma associated with the intersection of transgender status and mental disorders 
had contributed to precarious legal status, human rights violations and barriers to appropriate 
health care in this population. Although gender identity is clearly distinct from sex, this chapter 
appeared to offer the most broadly acceptable home for categories related to gender identity, 
while making it clear that they are no longer considered to be mental disorders. This position has 
been supported by a series of ICD-11 field studies. Gender incongruence was not proposed for 
elimination in ICD-11 because in many countries access to relevant health services is contingent 
on a qualifying diagnosis.
Chapter 21. Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified
The categories in this chapter are not considered to be disorders but rather provide descriptions 
of specific symptoms that may be used to describe the reason for a clinical encounter when a 
more precise diagnosis has not been established for various reasons. These categories may also 
be used to describe clinically important aspects of the individual’s presentation when a diagnosis 
has been assigned.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

A part of this chapter is a detailed and comprehensive listing of mental or behavioural symptoms, 
signs or clinical findings, which also includes definitions for each. These often represent 
important problems in their own right (e.g. avolition, demoralization, apathy, thought blocking). 
The categories from this section can be used to describe the clinical presentation in the absence 
of a definitive mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis. In addition, these 
categories can be useful when a mental disorder diagnosis has been assigned, and the symptom 
being described has implications for treatment but is not an essential feature of the disorder itself 
and does not meet the diagnostic requirements for a co-occurring disorder. A listing of mental or 
behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings included in this chapter, with their definitions, 
is provided as part of the CDDR (p. 677).
Chapter 24. Factors influencing health status or contact with health 
services
Categories from this chapter may be used when a person seeks mental health services for a reason 
other than for symptoms of a mental disorder (e.g. counselling for a problem associated with 
unemployment), or when the problem influences the person’s health status but is not in itself a 
mental disorder. A number of categories in this chapter are relevant to mental health professionals 
because they:
• represent a reason for a clinical encounter other than a mental disorder (e.g. counselling 
related to sexuality, counselling related to procreative management);
• are a focus of intervention (e.g. relationship problems and maltreatment – see p. 707);
• are important to consider in the differential diagnosis of mental disorders (e.g. uncomplicated 
bereavement, malingering); or
• are factors that may significantly contribute to the initiation or maintenance of disorders in 
the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter, including recognized 
social determinants of mental health (i.e. problems associated with finances, problems 
associated with employment or unemployment, target of perceived adverse discrimination 
or persecution).
A listing of factors influencing health status or contact with health services that are particularly 
relevant to mental health and mental health services is provided as part of the CDDR (p. 733).
ICD-11 diagnostic coding
Among the most important innovations of ICD-11 is its ability to capture much more clinical 
information associated with a particular diagnosis than was possible with ICD-10. Some of the 
ICD-11 coding features discussed in this section are designed for optimal use in the context of 
electronic information systems able to generate and interpret complex, multipart codes – for 
example, based on checklists completed by the health professional. However, some of these 
coding capabilities will also be useful to health professionals who are individually responsible 
for determining and recording diagnoses and diagnostic codes. Even when coding itself is 
done by professional coders, as in some countries and health systems, it is important for health 
professionals to understand the information needed to generate the most accurate and useful 
codes so that they are better able to provide this information as a part of the medical record, even 
if it is recorded by hand.
ICD-10 codes contained a letter of the alphabet in the first position, which indicated the chapter 
in which the category was classified. (The codes for ICD-10 mental and behavioural disorders 
all began with the letter “F”.) This was sufficient for the 22 chapters in ICD-10. All the other 
characters in the ICD-10 codes were limited to numbers, which imposed a limit of 10 subdivisions 

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
at each level corresponding to each digit in the diagnostic code. Moreover, ICD-10 allowed for 
the coding of only limited disorder-specific clinical information within a diagnostic code via the 
provision of specifiers and subtypes that could be codified in the fourth, fifth or sixth characters 
in an ICD-10 code.
ICD-11, like ICD-10 and its predecessors, also conveys diagnostic information based on the 
various positions and values of alphanumeric characters within a diagnostic code. The first 
character of an ICD-11 code indicates the top-level chapter; for example, if the first character is 
a “6”, the code is found in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter. 
The second and third characters taken together indicate the diagnostic class or grouping (e.g. 6A7 
for depressive disorders, 6B0 for anxiety and fear-related disorders). The fourth character typically 
indicates the specific disorder within that class (e.g. 6A70 for single episode depressive disorder, 
6A71 for recurrent depressive disorder), but in cases in which these number more than 10, letters 
of the alphabet are used after the digits 0–9 are exhausted. For example, the fourth character in the 
ICD-11 codes for disorders due to substance use indicates the substance class. Because ICD-11 
recognizes 14 different specific substance classes, the fourth character codes for the last four 
substance classes required resorting to letters (e.g. the code for disorders due to use of volatile 
inhalants is 6C4B.)
The fifth character (following a decimal point) generally indicates subtypes or specifiers applicable 
to that diagnosis (e.g. 6A70.0 for single episode, mild; 6A70.1 for single episode, moderate, 
without psychotic symptoms; 6A70.2 for single episode, moderate, with psychotic symptoms). 
The ICD-11 codes for some disorders with more complicated systems for specifiers might require 
the use of a sixth character. For example, the fifth character for acute and transient psychotic 
disorder indicates whether it is the first episode (6A23.0) or one of multiple episodes (6A23.1). 
Indicating whether it is currently symptomatic or in remission requires a sixth character. That is, 
for 6A23.0 Acute and transient psychotic disorder, first episode, 6A23.00 is currently symptomatic; 
6A23.01 is currently in partial remission; and 6A23.02 is currently in full remission. ICD-11 
refers to this method of providing unique codes for all possible combinations of first or multiple 
episodes and currently symptomatic or partial remission or full remission for acute and transient 
psychotic disorder as “precoordination”.
ICD-11 offers an additional coding convention that goes beyond just capturing clinical 
information within the confines of a single diagnostic code by allowing additional codes to be 
linked to the initial diagnostic code for the purpose of indicating additional clinically significant 
features. ICD-11 refers to this method of combining codes as “postcoordination”. One type of 
postcoordination used in the chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders 
involves appending codes that indicate specific symptomatic or course presentations that are 
applicable only to diagnoses within a particular diagnostic grouping. These include symptomatic 
manifestations of primary psychotic disorders; symptomatic and course presentations for mood 
episodes in mood disorders; prominent personality traits or patterns in personality disorders; 
and behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia. For example, the diagnostic codes 
indicating symptomatic and course presentations for mood episodes applicable only to mood 
disorders include the following
• 6A80.0 indicates the presence of prominent anxiety symptoms during a mood episode.
• 6A80.1 indicates that two or more panic attacks have occurred during a mood episode.
• 6A80.2 indicates that a current depressive episode is persistent.
• 6A80.3 indicates that a current depressive episode is characterized by melancholia.
• 6A80.4 indicates a seasonal pattern of mood episode onset and remission.
• 6A80.5 indicates a rapid cycling course (applicable only to bipolar type I and bipolar type II 
disorders).

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The diagnostic code 6A71.3/6A80.3, for example, indicates recurrent depressive disorder, current 
episode severe, without psychotic symptoms (6A71.3), with melancholia (6A80.3).	
Another form of postcoordination is through the use of “extension codes”, which are generic 
codes that can be applied across the categories in the different chapters of ICD-11. Extension 
codes for severity – none (XS8H), mild (XS5W), moderate (XS0T) and severe (XS25) – are 
used in several places in the ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Extension codes are appended to the diagnostic code they are modifying using an 
ampersand (&). For example, 6D80&XS0T is the code for dementia due to Alzheimer disease 
(6D80) of moderate severity (XS0T). Extension codes can also be used to indicate a provisional 
diagnosis (XY7Z) or to designate a differential diagnosis (XY75). For example, 6A02&XY7Z is 
the code to indicate a provisional diagnosis (XY7Z) of autism spectrum disorder (6A02).
The coding for schizophrenia illustrates how a combination of precoordinated and postcoordinated 
codes, including extension codes for severity, can be used to characterize course and symptomatic 
manifestations more fully. Clinical course of schizophrenia is indicated using a combination of 
fifth-character codes (“0” for first episode, “1” for multiple episodes, “2” for continuous course) 
and sixth-character codes (“0” for currently symptomatic, “1” for in partial remission, “2” for in 
full remission). Dimensional profiles of current symptomatic manifestations can be indicated by 
adding codes from the symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders that represent 
specific symptom domains:
• 6A25.0 for positive symptoms;
• 6A25.1 for negative symptoms;
• 6A25.2 for depressive mood symptoms;
• 6A25.3 for manic mood symptoms;
• 6A25.4 for psychomotor symptoms; and
• 6A25.5 for cognitive symptoms.
The above codes for symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders can be used in 
combination with extension codes to indicate the severity of each symptom domain, respectively, 
thus providing a symptomatic profile of the presenting symptoms for schizophrenia for a 
particular individual at a particular point in time. The web-based browser for ICD-11 for MMS4 
can be used to construct the diagnostic coding for those disorders with complex combinations of 
specifiers and extensions. For example, schizophrenia, first episode, currently symptomatic with 
moderate positive symptoms, with severe negative symptoms, absent depressed mood symptoms, 
absent manic mood symptoms, mild psychomotor symptoms and severe cognitive symptoms 
yields the following combined diagnostic code:
6A20.00/6A25.0&XS0T/6A25.1&XS25/6A25.2&XS8H/6A25.3&XS8H/6A25.4&XS5W/6A25.5&XS25
As indicated, generating and interpreting this type of complex, multipart code will be most 
feasible for relatively sophisticated electronic health information systems. It is not expected that 
such complex codes will be used routinely by individual clinicians recording diagnoses by hand, 
for example.
Coding of mental disorders caused by health conditions not classified 
under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
ICD-11, as was the case with ICD-10, requires that two diagnostic codes be given for symptomatic 
presentations of mental disorders that are judged to be a manifestation of a health condition (i.e. 
disorder, disease or injury) classified outside Chapter 6. 

 ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11 MMS) [website]. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2023 (https://ICD.who.
int/browse11/l-m/en#/).

Using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical settings
One code from the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter indicates 
the mental disorder diagnosis, and a second code indicates the etiological medical condition. 
Note that the CDDR often use the generic term “medical condition” to refer to health conditions 
that are not mental disorders (i.e. not classified in the chapter on mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders). This is only a shorthand; it is not intended to suggest that mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders are not health conditions.
The convention of double coding as it applies to the grouping of secondary mental or behavioural 
syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere involves assigning the 
code for the presumed underlying disorder or disease in combination with the code for the 
phenomenologically relevant secondary mental disorder. The earlier example of presentation 
consisting of depressive symptoms similar to those of a depressive episode that are judged to 
be due to hypothyroidism would be indicated by combining the diagnostic code for secondary 
mood syndrome, with depressive symptoms (6E62.0) with the appropriate diagnostic code 
from the hypothyroidism grouping – for example, transient congenital hypothyroidism 
(5A00.03), yielding the combination code 6E62.0/5A00.03. This coding convention also applies 
to neurocognitive disorders such as dementia due to different types of underlying diseases; for 
example, frontotemporal dementia requires two codes: 6D83 for the syndrome of frontotemporal 
dementia plus 8A23 frontotemporal lobar degeneration from Chapter 8 on diseases of the 
nervous system, yielding a combined code of 6D83/8A23. Importantly, the order of the codes 
being combined is not meaningful in this situation; it is not necessary to list the primary disorder 
first. That is, 6D83/8A23 has the same meaning as 8A23/6D83.
Secondary parenting
The ICD-11 classification is divided into 25 chapters, generally based on organ system (e.g. 
diseases of the digestive system), anatomic location (e.g. diseases of the ear and mastoid process), 
common pathophysiological process (e.g. certain infectious or parasitic disorders; neoplasms) 
or medical specialty (e.g. separating diseases of the nervous system from mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders). Many diseases in ICD-11 could have been placed in more 
than one chapter (e.g. pancreatic cancer could have been plausibly placed in either the diseases 
of the digestive system or the neoplasms chapter). ICD-11 acknowledges this fact by sometimes 
locating the same disorder in two (or more) chapters, with one of the chapters considered to be 
the “primary parent” and other chapter(s) termed “secondary parent(s)”.
For example, the grouping of primary tics and tic disorders is listed in both Chapter 8 on diseases 
of the nervous system (within the movement disorders grouping) and the mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter (within the neurodevelopmental disorders grouping). 
They are primary-parented in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system and secondary-parented 
in the mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders chapter. The code number in both 
instances is the same and corresponds to the primary parent. For example, the code for Tourette 
syndrome is 8A05.00. The “8” in the first digit of the code indicates that it is primary-parented in 
Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system. The same code (8A05.00) is retained when Tourette 
syndrome appears as a part of the grouping of neurodevelopmental disorders in Chapter 6.

ICD-11 Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders
Note: the following list contains all the available codes in the ICD-11 chapter on mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders.
As described in the section of this manual on using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders (p.  21), ICD-11 uses secondary parenting to cross-list categories 
from other parts of the classification that share important primary clinical features or other linkages 
with the disorders contained in a particular grouping. This most commonly involves substance-
induced mental disorders and secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with 
disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, which are also classified in Chapter 6. In several cases, 
however, this involves categories from other chapters of ICD-11 (e.g. the inclusion of primary tics 
and tic disorders from Chapter 8 on disorders of the nervous system with neurodevelopmental 
disorders). These secondary-parented categories also appear in the list below with the groupings 
to which they are cross-listed, in grey font.
In ICD-11, postcoordination is a mechanism for allowing additional codes to be linked to the initial 
diagnostic code to identify additional clinically significant features of the clinical presentation. 
See the section on using the CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders (p. 21). Postcoordination options for each disorder grouping appear also appear in the 
list below, in boxes.
In some cases, ellipses (…) are used to improve the readability of the list by avoiding repetition 
of the disorder name. When used, ellipses signify the category name that appears in the level 
immediately above. For example, below 6A01.2 Developmental language disorder, the title for 
6A01.20 appears as “… with impairment of receptive and expressive language” rather using 
the full name of the category, “6A01.20 Developmental language disorder with impairment of 
receptive and expressive language”.

Mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders
Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders are syndromes characterized by clinically 
significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation or behaviour that 
reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological or developmental processes that underlie 
mental and behavioural functioning. These disturbances are usually associated with distress 
or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas 
of functioning.

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Neurodevelopmental disorders are behavioural and cognitive disorders arising during the 
developmental period that involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution 
of specific intellectual, motor, language or social functions. In this context, arising during the 
developmental period is typically considered to mean that these disorders have their onset prior 
to 18 years of age, regardless of the age at which the individual first comes to clinical attention. 
Although behavioural and cognitive deficits are present in many mental and behavioural 
disorders that can arise during the developmental period (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), 
only disorders whose core features are neurodevelopmental are included in this grouping. 
The presumptive etiology for neurodevelopmental disorders is complex, and in many individual 
cases is unknown, but they are presumed to be primarily due to genetic or other factors that are 
present from birth. However, lack of appropriate environmental stimulation and lack of adequate 
learning opportunities and experiences may also be contributory factors in neurodevelopmental 
disorders and should be considered routinely in their assessment. Certain neurodevelopmental 
disorders may also arise from injury, disease or other insult to the central nervous system, when 
this occurs during the developmental period.

General cultural considerations for neurodevelopmental disorders
•	 The evaluation of the essential features of most of the disorders in this section either 
depends on or is informed by standardized assessments. The cultural appropriateness of 
tests and norms used to assess intellectual, motor, language or social abilities should be 
considered for each individual. Test performance may be affected by cultural biases (e.g. 
reference in test items to terminology or objects not common to a culture) and limitations 
of translation. Language proficiency must also be considered when interpreting test results. 
Where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, assessment of the 
essential features of these disorders requires greater reliance on clinical judgement based 
on appropriate evidence and assessment.
Disorders of intellectual development
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of significant limitations in intellectual functioning across various domains 
such as perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed and verbal comprehension 
is required for diagnosis. There is often substantial variability in the extent to which any 
of these domains are affected in an individual. Whenever possible, performance should be 
measured using appropriately normed, standardized tests of intellectual functioning and 
found to be approximately 2 or more standard deviations below the mean (i.e. approximately 
less than the 2.3rd percentile). In situations where appropriately normed and standardized 
tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement based on appropriate evidence and assessment, which may include the 
use of behavioural indicators of intellectual functioning (see Table 6.1, p. 101).
•	 The presence of significant limitations in adaptive behaviour, which refers to the set of 
conceptual, social and practical skills that have been learned and are performed by people in 
their everyday lives, is an essential component. Conceptual skills are those that involve the 
application of knowledge (e.g. reading, writing, calculating, solving problems and making 
decisions) and communication; social skills include managing interpersonal interactions 
6A00
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Neurodevelopmental disorders
and relationships, social responsibility, following rules and obeying laws, and avoiding 
victimization; and practical skills are involved in areas such as self-care, health and safety, 
occupational skills, recreation, use of money, mobility and transportation, as well as use 
of home appliances and technological devices. Expectations of adaptive functioning 
may change in response to environmental demands that change with age. Whenever 
possible, performance should be measured with appropriately normed, standardized tests 
of adaptive behaviour and the total score found to be approximately 2 or more standard 
deviations below the mean (i.e. approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile). In situations 
where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not available, assessment of 
adaptive behaviour functioning requires greater reliance on clinical judgement based on 
appropriate assessment, which may include the use of behavioural indicators of adaptive 
behaviour skills (see Tables 6.2–6.4, pp. 104–111).
•	 Onset occurs during the developmental period. Among adults with disorders of intellectual 
development who come to clinical attention without a previous diagnosis, it is possible to 
establish developmental onset through the person’s history (retrospective diagnosis).
Severity specifiers
The severity of a disorder of intellectual development is determined by considering both the 
individual’s level of intellectual ability and level of adaptive behaviour, ideally assessed using 
appropriately normed, individually administered standardized tests. Where appropriately 
normed and standardized tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning and 
adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on clinical judgement based on appropriate evidence 
and assessment, which may include the use of behavioural indicators of intellectual and adaptive 
functioning provided in Tables 6.1–6.4.
Generally, the level of severity should be assigned on the basis of the level at which the majority 
of the individual’s intellectual ability and adaptive behaviour skills across all three domains – 
conceptual, social and practical skills – fall. For example, if intellectual functioning and two of 
three adaptive behaviour domains are determined to be 3–4 standard deviations below the mean, 
moderate disorder of intellectual development would be the most appropriate diagnosis. However, 
this formulation may vary according to the nature and purpose of the assessment, as well as the 
importance of the behaviour in question in relation to the individual’s overall functioning.
Disorder of intellectual development, mild
•	 In mild disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour 
are found to be approximately 2–3 standard deviations below the mean (approximately 
0.1–2.3 percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually administered standardized 
tests. Where standardized tests are not available, assessment of intellectual functioning and 
adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on clinical judgement, which may include 
the use of behavioural indicators provided in Tables 6.1–6.4. People with mild disorder of 
intellectual development often exhibit difficulties in the acquisition and comprehension of 
complex language concepts and academic skills. Most master basic self-care, domestic and 
practical activities. Affected people can generally achieve relatively independent living and 
employment as adults, but may require appropriate support.
6A00.0
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Disorder of intellectual development, moderate
•	 In moderate disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive 
behaviour are found to be approximately 3–4 standard deviations below the mean 
(approximately 0.003–0.1 percentile), based on appropriately normed, individually 
administered standardized tests. Where standardized tests are not available, assessment 
of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on clinical 
judgement, which may include the use of behavioural indicators provided in Tables 
6.1–6.4. Language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills of people affected by 
moderate disorder of intellectual development vary but are generally limited to basic skills. 
Some may master basic self-care, domestic and practical activities. Most affected people 
require considerable and consistent support in order to achieve independent living and 
employment as adults.
Disorder of intellectual development, severe
•	 In severe disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive 
behaviour are found to be approximately 4 or more standard deviations below the 
mean (less than approximately the 0.003rd percentile), based on appropriately normed, 
individually administered standardized tests. Where standardized tests are not available, 
assessment of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance 
on clinical judgement, which may include the use of behavioural indicators provided 
in Tables 6.1–6.4. People affected by severe disorder of intellectual development exhibit 
very limited language and capacity for acquisition of academic skills. They may also have 
motor impairments and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for 
adequate care, but may acquire basic self-care skills with intensive training. Severe and 
profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the basis 
of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence cannot 
reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning below the 
0.003rd percentile.
Disorder of intellectual development, profound
•	 In profound disorder of intellectual development, intellectual functioning and adaptive 
behaviour are found to be approximately 4 or more standard deviations below the mean 
(approximately less than the 0.003rd percentile), based on individually administered 
appropriately normed, standardized tests. Where standardized tests are not available, 
assessment of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement, which may include the use of behavioural indicators provided in Tables 
6.1–6.4. People affected by profound disorder of intellectual development possess very 
limited communication abilities and capacity for acquisition of academic skills is restricted 
to basic concrete skills. They may also have co-occurring motor and sensory impairments 
and typically require daily support in a supervised environment for adequate care. Severe 
and profound disorders of intellectual development are differentiated exclusively on the 
basis of adaptive behaviour differences because existing standardized tests of intelligence 
cannot reliably or validly distinguish among individuals with intellectual functioning 
below the 0.003rd percentile.

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Disorder of intellectual development, provisional
•	 Provisional disorder of intellectual development is assigned when there is evidence of a 
disorder of intellectual development but the individual is an infant or child under the age 
of 4 years, making it difficult to ascertain whether the observed impairments represent 
a transient delay. Provisional disorder of intellectual development in this context is 
sometimes referred to as “global developmental delay”. The diagnosis can also be assigned 
in individuals 4 years of age or older when evidence is suggestive of a disorder of intellectual 
development but it is not possible to conduct a valid assessment of intellectual functioning 
and adaptive behaviour because of sensory or physical impairments (e.g. blindness, pre-
lingual deafness), motor or communication impairments, severe problem behaviours, or 
symptoms of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder that interfere 
with assessment.
Disorder of intellectual development, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 No single physical feature or personality type is common to all individuals with disorders 
of intellectual development, although specific etiological groups may have common 
physical characteristics.
•	 Disorders of intellectual development are associated with a high rate of co-occurring 
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, clinical presentations 
may vary depending on the individual’s age, level of severity of the disorder of intellectual 
development, communication skills and symptom complexity. Some disorders – such 
as autism spectrum disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar and related disorders, 
schizophrenia, dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – occur more 
commonly among individuals with disorders of intellectual development than in the 
general population. Individuals with a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development 
and other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders are at similar risk of 
suicide as individuals with mental disorders who do not have a co-occurring disorder of 
intellectual development.
•	 Problem or challenging behaviours such as aggression, self-injurious behaviour, attention-
seeking behaviour, oppositional defiant behaviour and sexually inappropriate behaviour 
are more frequent among those with disorders of intellectual development than in the 
general population.
•	 Many individuals with disorders of intellectual development are more gullible and naive, 
easier to deceive, and more prone to acquiescence and confabulation than people in the 
general population. This can lead to various consequences, including greater likelihood 
of victimization, becoming involved in criminal activities and providing inaccurate 
statements to law enforcement.
•	 Significant life changes and traumatic experiences can be particularly difficult for a person 
with a disorder of intellectual development. Whereas the timing and type of life transitions 
vary across societies, it is generally the case that individuals with disorders of intellectual 
6A00.4
6A00.Z
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

development need additional support adapting to changes in routine, structure, or 
educational or living arrangements.
•	 Many medical conditions can cause disorders of intellectual development and are, in turn, 
associated with specific additional medical problems. A variety of prenatal (e.g. exposure 
to toxic substances or harmful medications), perinatal (e.g. labour and delivery problems) 
and postnatal (e.g. infectious encephalopathies) factors may contribute to the development 
of disorders of intellectual development, and multiple etiologies may interact. Early 
diagnosis of the etiology of a disorder of intellectual development, when possible, can 
assist in the prevention and management of related medical problems (e.g. frequent thyroid 
disease screening is recommended for individuals with Down syndrome). If the etiology of 
a disorder of intellectual development in a particular individual has been established, the 
diagnosis corresponding to that etiology should also be assigned.
•	 Individuals with disorders of intellectual development are at greater risk of a variety of 
health (e.g. epilepsy) and social (e.g. poverty) problems across the lifespan.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 In disorders of intellectual development, a measure of intelligence quotient (IQ) is not 
an isolated diagnostic requirement to distinguish disorder from normality, but should be 
considered a proxy measure of the “significant limitations in intellectual functioning” that 
partially characterize disorders of intellectual development. IQ scores may vary as a result 
of the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and a 
variety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s development 
and life-course. The diagnosis of disorders of intellectual development should not be 
made solely based on IQ scores but must also include a comprehensive evaluation of 
adaptive behaviour.
•	 Scores on individually administered standardized tests of intellectual and adaptive 
functioning may vary considerably over the course of an individual’s development, and it 
is quite possible that, during the developmental period, a child may meet the diagnostic 
requirements of disorders of intellectual development on one occasion but not another. 
Multiple testing on different occasions during the developmental trajectory is necessary to 
establish a reliable estimate of functioning.
•	 Special care should be taken in differentiating disorders of intellectual development 
from normality when evaluating people with communication, sensory or motor 
impairments; those exhibiting behavioural disturbances; immigrants; people with low 
literacy levels; people with mental disorders; people undergoing medical treatments 
(e.g. pharmacotherapy); and people who have experienced severe social or sensory 
deprivation. If not adequately addressed during the evaluation, these factors may reduce 
the validity of scores obtained on standardized or behavioural measures of intellectual and 
adaptive functioning. For example, the reliable use of standardized measures of intellectual 
functioning and adaptive behaviour may pose particular challenges among individuals 
with motor coordination and communication impairments, and assessments must be 
selected that are appropriate to the individual’s capacities.
•	 What is sometimes termed “borderline intellectual functioning”, defined as intellectual 
functioning between approximately 1 and 2 standard deviations below the mean, is not a 
diagnosable disorder. Nonetheless, such individuals may present many needs for support and 
interventions that are similar to those of people with disorders of intellectual development.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Course features
•	 Disorders of intellectual development are lifespan conditions that typically manifest during 
early childhood and require consideration of developmental phases and life transitions 
whereby periods of relatively greater need may alternate with those where less support 
may be necessary.
•	 Disorders of intellectual development may show individual as well as etiology-specific 
variation in developmental trajectories (i.e. periods of relative decline or amelioration in 
functioning). Intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour can vary substantially across 
the lifespan. Results from a single assessment, particularly those obtained during early 
childhood, may be of limited predictive use, as later functioning will be influenced by the 
level and type of interventions and support provided.
•	 People with disorders of intellectual development typically need exceptional support 
throughout the lifespan, although the types and intensities of required support often change 
over time depending on age, development, environmental factors and life circumstances. 
Most people with disorders of intellectual development continue to acquire skills and 
competencies over time. Providing interventions and support – including education – 
assists with this process and, if provided during the developmental period, may result in 
lower support needs in adulthood.
Developmental presentations
•	 There is wide variability in the developmental presentation and developmental trajectories 
of individuals with disorders of intellectual development. Tables 6.2–6.4 provide clinicians 
with some of the key areas of strengths and weaknesses typically observed at different time 
points across development (i.e. early childhood, childhood, adolescence and adulthood) in 
individuals with disorders of intellectual development.
•	 Conditions related to disorders of intellectual development may be suspected during the 
first days and months of life due to the presence of certain physical signs such as facial 
dimorphisms, congenital malformation, micro- or macrocephalia, low weight, hypotonia, 
physical growth retardation, metabolic problems and failure to thrive, among others.
•	 In older children, disorders of intellectual development may manifest as problems in 
acquiring academic knowledge and abilities such as reading, writing and arithmetic. Many 
children with mild disorder of intellectual development may not be referred for evaluation 
until they reach school age. Some individuals may remain undiagnosed until much later, 
during adolescence or adulthood.
•	 The manifestations of disorders of intellectual development during late adolescence and the 
first years of adulthood may be strongly influenced by the presence of challenges related to 
assuming adult roles, such as postsecondary education, employment, independent living 
and adult relationships.
•	 Older adults with disorders of intellectual development may present with a more rapid 
onset of dementia or declining skills than older adults in the general population. They 
also have significantly more difficulty gaining access to necessary support and appropriate 
health care for medical problems.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 The cultural appropriateness of tests and norms used to assess intellectual and adaptive 
functioning should be considered for each individual. Test performance may be affected 
by cultural biases (e.g. reference in test items to terminology or objects not common to a 
culture) and limitations of translation.
•	 In evaluating adaptive functioning (i.e. the individual’s conceptual, social and practical 
skills), the expectations of the individual’s culture and social environment should be 
considered.
•	 Language proficiency must also be considered when interpreting test results, in terms 
of both its impact on verbal performance and whether the individual understood 
the instructions.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The overall prevalence of disorders of intellectual development is slightly higher in 
males. The prevalence of some etiologies of disorders of intellectual development differs 
between males and females (e.g. X-linked genetic conditions such as fragile X syndrome 
are predominantly diagnosed in males, whereas Turner syndrome occurs exclusively in 
females).
•	 A number of associated features of disorders of intellectual development differ between 
males and females – for example, in the expression of problem behaviours and co-occurring 
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Males are more likely to exhibit 
hyperactivity and conduct disturbances, whereas females are more likely to exhibit mood 
and anxiety symptoms.
•	 Reduced social value and expectations placed on females compared to males in some 
societies may negatively affect the accurate identification and provision of support for 
females with disorders of intellectual development.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with developmental speech and language disorders 
In developmental speech and language disorders, individuals exhibit difficulties in understanding or 
producing speech and language, or in using language in context for the purposes of communication 
that is markedly below what would be expected given the individual’s age and level of intellectual 
functioning. If speech and language abilities are significantly below what would be expected based 
on intellectual and adaptive behaviour functioning in an individual with a disorder of intellectual 
development, an additional diagnosis of developmental speech and language disorder may 
be assigned.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in reciprocal social interaction and 
social communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, inflexible patterns of behaviour and 
interests. Although many individuals with autism spectrum disorder present with the significant 
limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour observed in disorders of intellectual 
development, autism spectrum disorder can also present without general limitations in intellectual 
functioning. In cases of autism spectrum disorder where there are significant limitations in 
intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour (i.e. 2 or more standard deviations below the mean 
or approximately less than the 2.3rd percentile) both the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder 
using the with disorder of intellectual development specifier and the diagnosis of a disorder of 
intellectual development at the corresponding level of severity should be assigned. The diagnosis 
of autism spectrum disorder in individuals with severe and profound disorders of intellectual 
development is particularly difficult, and requires in-depth and longitudinal assessments. Because 
autism spectrum disorder inherently involves social deficits, assessment of adaptive behaviour as 
a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development should place greater 
emphasis on the conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills.
Boundary with developmental learning disorders
Developmental learning disorders are characterized by significant and persistent difficulties in 
learning academic skills including reading, writing and arithmetic, with performance in these areas 
markedly below what would be expected based on chronological age or intellectual level. Individuals 
with disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academic achievement 
by virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is therefore difficult to 
establish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individuals with a 
disorder of intellectual development. However, developmental learning disorders can co-occur 
in some individuals with disorders of intellectual development if, despite adequate opportunities, 
acquisition of learning is significantly below what is expected based on established intellectual 
functioning. In such cases, both disorders may be diagnosed.
Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorders
In developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals exhibit significant delays during the 
developmental period in the acquisition of gross and fine motor skills, and impairment in the 
execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy of motor 
performance. Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may also display such motor 
coordination difficulties that affect adaptive behaviour functioning. In contrast to those with 
developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals with disorders of intellectual development 
have accompanying significant limitations in intellectual functioning. However, if coordinated 
motor skills are significantly below what would be expected based on level of intellectual functioning 
and adaptive behaviour, and represent a separate focus of clinical attention, both diagnoses may 
be assigned.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
In attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, individuals show a persistent and generalized pattern 
of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that emerges during the developmental period. 
If all diagnostic requirements for a disorder of intellectual development are met, and inattention 
and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity are found to be outside normal expected limits based on age and 
level of intellectual functioning, with significant interference in academic, occupational or social 
functioning, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with dementia
In dementia, affected individuals – usually older adults – exhibit a decline from a previous level 
of functioning in multiple cognitive domains that interferes significantly with performance of 
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

activities of daily living. The disorders can co-occur, and some adults with disorders of intellectual 
development are at greater and earlier risk of developing dementia. For example, individuals 
with Down syndrome who exhibit a marked decline in adaptive behaviour functioning should be 
evaluated for the emergence of dementia. In cases in which the diagnostic requirements for both a 
disorder of intellectual development and dementia are met and describe non-redundant aspects of 
the clinical presentation, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with other mental and behavioural disorders
Other mental and behavioural disorders such as schizophrenia and other primary psychotic 
disorders may include symptoms that interfere with intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. 
A disorder of intellectual development should not be diagnosed if the limitations are better accounted 
for by another mental and behavioural disorder. However, other mental and behavioural disorders 
are at least as prevalent in individuals with disorders of intellectual development as in the general 
population, and co-occurring diagnoses should be assigned if warranted. In evaluating mental and 
behavioural disorders in individuals with disorders of intellectual development, signs and symptoms 
must be assessed using methods that are appropriate to the individual’s level of development and 
intellectual functioning, and may require a greater reliance on observable signs and the reports of 
others who are familiar with the individual.
Boundary with sensory impairments
If not addressed, sensory impairments (e.g. visual, auditory) can interfere with opportunities for 
learning, resulting in apparent limitations in intellectual functioning or adaptive behaviour. If the 
observed limitations are solely attributable to a sensory impairment, a disorder of intellectual 
development should not be assigned. However, prolonged sensory impairment throughout the 
critical period of development may result in the persistence of limitations in intellectual functioning 
or adaptive behaviour, despite later intervention, and an additional diagnosis of a disorder of 
intellectual development may be warranted in such cases.
Boundary with effects of psychosocial deprivation
Extreme psychosocial deprivation in early childhood can produce severe and selective impairments 
in specific mental functions such as language, social interaction and emotional expression. 
Depending on the onset, level of severity and duration of the deprivation, functioning in these 
areas may improve substantially after the child is moved to a more positive environment. However, 
some deficits may persist even after a sustained period in an environment that provides adequate 
stimulation for development, and a diagnosis of a disorder of intellectual development may be 
appropriate in such cases if all diagnostic requirements are met.
Boundary with neurodegenerative diseases
Neurodegenerative diseases can be associated with disorders of intellectual development but only 
if they have their onset in the developmental period (e.g. mucolipidosis type I, Gaucher’s disease 
type III). If a neurodegenerative disease co-occurs with a disorder of intellectual development, both 
diagnoses should be assigned.
Boundary with secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome
If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are met and the symptoms 
are attributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, both 
disorder of intellectual development and the underlying medical conditions should be diagnosed. 
If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual development are not met (e.g. limitations 
in intellectual functioning without limitations in adaptive functioning) and the symptoms are 
attributed to medical conditions with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, a diagnosis 
of secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome should be assigned, together with the diagnosis 
corresponding to the underlying medical condition.

up to 2-step instructions.
•	Most can make one-to-one 
correspondence or match 
to sample (e.g. organize 
or match items according 
to shape, size, colour).
•	Most can communicate their 
immediate future goals (e.g. 
desired activities for the day).
•	Most can express their likes and 
dislikes in relationships (e.g. who

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development
Note: the presence or absence of particular behavioural indicators listed in the table is not sufficient to assign a diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development. 
Clinical judgement is a necessary component in determining whether an individual has a diagnosable disorder, and diagnosis relies on the following key assumptions being met:
•	 Limitations in present functioning have been considered within the context of community environments typical of the individual’s age peers and culture.
•	 Valid assessment has considered cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as differences in communication, sensory, motor and behavioural factors.
•	 Within an individual, limitations are recognized to often coexist alongside strengths and both were considered during the assessment.
•	 Limitations are described, in part, to develop a profile of needed support.
•	 It is recognized that with appropriate support over a sustained period, the life functioning of the affected person generally will improve.
•	 Please consult the CDDR for disorders of intellectual development and, if applicable, autism spectrum disorder for guidance on how to determine the severity level.

Note: the behavioural indicators in the table are intended to be used by the clinician in determining the level of severity of the disorder of intellectual development, either as a 
complement to properly normed, standardized tests, or when such tests are unavailable or inappropriate given the individual’s cultural and linguistic background. Use of these 
indicators is predicated on the clinician’s knowledge of and experience with typically developing individuals of comparable age. Unless explicitly stated, the behavioural indicators 
of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour functioning for each severity level are what are typically expected to be mastered by the individual by 6 years of age. Please 
consult the CDDR for disorders of intellectual development and, if applicable, autism spectrum disorder for guidance on how to determine the severity level.

•	Most will be unable to learn 
to prepare foods or assist in 
the kitchen, or use simple 
household devices (e.g. 
switches, stoves, microwaves).
•	Most will not learn rules 
and safe behaviours in the 
home and community.
•	Most will require a lot of 
supervision to remain on task and 
be engaged in basic vocational 
or pre-vocational skills.

Note: the behavioural indicators in the table are intended to be used by the clinician in determining the level of severity of the disorder of intellectual development, either as a 
complement to properly normed, standardized tests, or when such tests are unavailable or inappropriate given the individual’s cultural and linguistic background. Use of these 
indicators is predicated on the clinician’s knowledge of and experience with typically developing individuals of comparable age. Unless explicitly stated, the behavioural indicators 
of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour functioning for each severity level are what are typically expected to be mastered by the individual by 18 years of age. Please 
consult the CDDR for disorders of intellectual development and, if applicable, autism spectrum disorder for guidance on how to determine the severity level.

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Disorders of intellectual development

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Developmental speech and language disorders
Developmental speech and language disorders are characterized by difficulties in understanding 
or producing speech and language or in using language in context for the purposes of 
communication. Developmental speech of language disorders include:
6A01.0 Developmental speech sound disorder
6A01.1 Developmental speech fluency disorder
6A01.2 Developmental language disorder
6A01.Y Other specified developmental speech or language disorder
6A01.Z Developmental speech or language disorder, unspecified.
Regional, social or cultural/ethnic language variations (e.g. dialects) must be considered when an 
individual is being assessed for language abilities. For example, phonological memory tasks may 
offer a less biased assessment compared to lexical tasks. A language history documenting all the 
languages the child has been exposed to since birth can assist in determining whether individual 
language variations are better explained by exposure to multiple languages rather than a speech 
or language pathology per se.
Developmental speech sound disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent errors of pronunciation, articulation or phonology (i.e. how language-based 
sounds are combined in culture-typical speech) that manifest as developmentally typical 
speech sound errors that persist substantially beyond the expected age or as atypical speech 
sound errors for the language spoken (e.g. word initial consonant deletion for English-
speaking children) are required for diagnosis.
•	 The onset of speech sound difficulties occurs during the early developmental period.
•	 Speech sound difficulties result in significant limitations in the ability to communicate due 
to reduced intelligibility of speech.
•	 The speech errors are not better accounted for by a disease of the nervous system affecting 
the brain, peripheral nerves or neuromusculature (e.g. cerebral palsy, myasthenia gravis); 
a sensory impairment (e.g. sensory neural deafness); or a structural abnormality (e.g. cleft 
palate) or other medical condition.
Additional clinical features
•	 Children with developmental speech sound disorder may exhibit delays in the acquisition, 
production and perception of spoken language.
6A01
6A01.0
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
•	 Phonological speech sound errors may be consistent or inconsistent. They often involve 
classes of sounds (e.g. incorrectly producing sounds in the same manner), a different 
place of articulation, or changes in syllable structure (e.g. deletion of final consonants or 
reducing consonant clusters to single consonants).
•	 If the speech errors are consistently produced, familiar listeners may be able to accommodate 
and decode the speech. However, when the rate of speech increases, even familiar listeners 
may not be able to understand the individual.
•	 Developmental speech sound disorder may be associated with imprecision and 
inconsistency of oral movements required for speech, especially in young children 
(also called childhood apraxia or dyspraxia of speech), resulting in difficulty producing 
sequences of speech sounds, specific consonants and vowels, and appropriate prosody 
(intonation and rhythm of speech). There may be some associated oral-motor dysfunction 
affecting early feeding, sucking and chewing, blowing, and imitating oral movements and 
speech sounds, but not with the weakness, slowness or incoordination found in dysarthria.
•	 Developmental speech sound disorder commonly co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental 
disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental speech fluency 
disorder and developmental language disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Children vary widely in the sequence and age at which they acquire speech sounds. Such 
normal variation does not reflect the presence of developmental speech sound disorder. In 
contrast, children with developmental speech sound disorder exhibit persistent problems 
that cause significant limitations in the ability to communicate due to reduced intelligibility 
of speech. Up until the age of 4 years, various speech sound errors are common among 
children with typically developing speech sound acquisition, but communication remains 
relatively intact despite these errors, relative to same-aged peers.
Course features
•	 Many young children with developmental speech sound disorder experience remission by 
school age. Among young children diagnosed in early childhood, up to 50–70% will exhibit 
academic difficulties throughout their schooling, even if the speech sound difficulties 
themselves have remitted.
•	 Compared to children and adolescents with a sole diagnosis of developmental speech 
sound disorder, those with a co-occurring developmental language disorder are more 
likely to develop other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders such as 
anxiety and fear-related disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. They are 
also more likely to exhibit greater difficulties academically, socially and adaptively by late 
childhood and adolescence.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Developmental presentations
•	 Prevalence rates vary but generally decrease with age such that prevalence can be as high 
as 16% at 3 or 4 years of age, approximately 4% at 6 years of age and 3.6% by 8 years of age. 
Therefore, many preschool-aged children diagnosed with developmental speech sound 
disorder exhibit typical speech sound development by the time they begin school.
•	 Some children with symptoms of developmental speech sound disorder early in life may 
only experience interference with functioning when they enter school, when the demands 
of the learning environment exceed their current abilities.
•	 Co-occurrence of other neurodevelopment disorders is more likely among children with 
persistent developmental speech sound disorder (whose speech sound errors continue 
beyond 8 or 9 years of age). In particular, these children are more likely to develop language 
impairments and reading difficulties, and tend to experience worse outcomes.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Developmental speech sound disorder is more prevalent among boys, especially at younger 
ages. Early speech difficulties in girls appear more likely to resolve by school age. Gender 
differences decline with age: the ratio of boys to girls affected appears to be 2:1 or 3:1 in 
early childhood, and to decline to 1.2:1 by 6 years of age.
•	 Boys are more likely to experience co-occurring language impairments.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Individuals with a disorder of intellectual development may exhibit impaired speech production. 
However, individuals with developmental speech sound disorder do not typically also have 
significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour. If speech production 
difficulties require separate clinical attention in the context of a disorder of intellectual development, 
an additional diagnosis of developmental speech sound disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with developmental speech fluency disorder and developmental 
language disorder
Like developmental speech sound disorder, developmental speech fluency disorder and 
developmental language disorder can result in reduced intelligibility that significantly affects 
communication. Developmental speech fluency disorder is characterized by disruption of the 
normal rhythmic flow and rate of speech. Developmental language disorder is characterized by 
persistent difficulties in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language. In contrast, 
developmental speech sound disorder is characterized by errors of pronunciation that are outside 
the limits of normal variation for chronological or developmental age.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Boundary with selective mutism
Selective mutism is characterized by consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child demonstrates 
adequate speech production in specific situations (typically at home) but predictably fails to speak 
in others (typically at school). Selective mutism can occur in the presence of developmental speech 
sound disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted.
Boundary with dysphonia
Dysphonia is characterized by abnormal voice production or absences of vocal quality, pitch, 
loudness, resonance or duration. It can be caused by voice strain or overuse, by structural laryngeal 
anomalies, or by diseases of the nervous system. It may result in the distortion of speech sounds 
due to the abnormal voice quality. In contrast, developmental speech sound disorder involves the 
omission or substitution of speech sounds and also includes distortion of speech sounds (e.g. due 
to incorrect tongue placement) rather than abnormal voice quality characteristic of dysphonia.
Boundary with dysarthria
Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder directly attributable to a disease of the nervous system or to 
either congenital or acquired brain injury. Dysarthria is characterized by difficulties with the range, 
rate, force, coordination and sustainability of movements throughout the vocal tract (i.e. trunk, 
larynx, palate, tongue, lips, jaw and face) that are required for speech. These motor difficulties 
often also cause frank difficulties in eating, drinking, swallowing or saliva control. A diagnosis of 
developmental speech sound disorder should not be assigned in these cases. Rather, a diagnosis of 
secondary speech or language syndrome should be assigned in addition to the associated medical 
condition if the speech sound difficulties are a specific focus of clinical attention.
Boundary with secondary speech or language syndrome
The diagnosis of developmental speech sound disorder should not be assigned in the presence 
of a disease of the nervous system affecting the brain, peripheral nerves or neuromusculature 
(e.g. cerebral palsy, myasthenia gravis); sensory impairment (e.g. sensory neural deafness); or 
structural impairment (e.g. cleft palate), although speech sound production difficulties may be a 
presenting feature of any of these conditions. In these cases, a diagnosis of secondary speech or 
language syndrome should be assigned in addition to the associated medical condition if the speech 
sound difficulties are a specific focus of clinical attention.
Developmental speech fluency disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Frequent or pervasive disruption of the normal rhythmic flow and rate of speech 
characterized by repetitions and prolongations in sounds, syllables, words and phrases, 
as well as blocking (inaudible or silent fixations or inability to initiate sounds) and word 
avoidance or substitutions, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The speech dysfluency is persistent over time.
•	 The onset of speech dysfluency occurs during the developmental period, and speech 
fluency is markedly below what would be expected based on age.
•	 Speech dysfluency results in significant impairment in social communication or in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
•	 The speech dysfluency is not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual development, 
a disease of the nervous system, a sensory impairment or a structural abnormality.
6A01.1
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Developmental speech fluency disorder includes cluttering, in which speech tends to be 
rapid, erratic and dysrhythmic, with breakdown in fluency and clarity, often with deletion 
or collapsing of syllables and omissions of word endings.
•	 Developmental speech fluency disorder may be accompanied by physical tension in 
the speech musculature, as well as body tension, struggle behaviour and secondary 
mannerisms, such as facial grimacing, eye blinking, head movements, and arm and leg 
movements such as leg tapping or fist clenching.
•	 Developmental speech fluency disorder is often accompanied by anxiety in anticipation of 
speaking and avoidance of speaking.
•	 The extent of the problem varies across situations and can be more severe when there is 
pressure to communicate.
•	 Developmental speech fluency disorder may be associated with a broader range of speech 
and language abnormalities.
•	 Occasionally, onset of dysfluency can be related to a significant psychological event such 
as bereavement, and is sometimes referred to as “psychogenic stammering”. When this 
occurs during the developmental period, it may be diagnosed as developmental speech 
fluency disorder.
•	 Approximately 60% of children with developmental speech fluency disorder exhibit co-
occurring developmental speech and language disorders.
•	 Among adolescents and adults with chronic speech dysfluencies, social anxiety is common 
and may exacerbate dysfluency. As many as 40–60% of these individuals meet the diagnostic 
requirements for social anxiety disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Many typically developing children show minor dysfluencies during the preschool years.
Course features
•	 The course of developmental speech fluency disorder may be relatively brief in many cases, 
with the majority of children (65–85%) remitting, without intervention, prior to puberty. 
Among these children, recovery is typically within the first 2 years after onset.
•	 The impact of developmental speech fluency disorder may be evident as early as 3 years of 
age, with impairments in emotional, behavioural and social domains compared to typically 
developing peers.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
•	 A more persistent course is associated with male gender, family history of developmental 
speech fluency disorder, age at onset of greater than 3–4 years of age, duration of more 
than 1 year, and co-occurring developmental language disorder. More severe presentations 
of the disorder in childhood are more likely to persist into adolescence and adulthood.
Developmental presentations
•	 Developmental speech fluency disorder emerges early in the developmental period, 
typically between 2.5 and 4 years of age. Around 5–8% of preschool-aged children exhibit 
stuttering; 80–90% of cases develop by age 6, and onset after age 9 is rare. The lifetime 
incidence of stuttering is estimated at 5%, whereas population prevalence is estimated at 
approximately 1%.
•	 Dysfluency tends to emerge gradually and may worsen as the individual becomes aware of 
their fluency difficulty. This may lead to development of mechanisms to avoid dysfluency 
or the associated emotional discomfort, further impairing speech (e.g. avoiding public 
speaking or limiting speech to simple and short phrases).
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Across the developmental period, boys are more commonly affected. Among preschool-
aged children, the ratio of boys to girls with developmental speech fluency disorder is 
estimated at 1.5:1. However, females are more likely to remit. Throughout school age and 
into adulthood, affected males are estimated to outnumber affected females by a ratio of 4:1.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with developmental speech sound disorder and developmental language 
disorder
Like developmental speech fluency disorder, developmental speech sound disorder and 
developmental language disorder can result in reduced intelligibility that significantly affects 
communication. Developmental speech sound disorder is characterized by errors of pronunciation 
that are outside the limits of normal variation for chronological or developmental age. Developmental 
language disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, understanding, 
production or use of language. In contrast, developmental speech fluency disorder is characterized 
by disruption of the normal rhythmic flow and rate of speech. If the diagnostic requirements for 
both developmental fluency disorder and another developmental speech and language disorder are 
met, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with primary tics and tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome
Dysfluency associated with other movements of the face or body that coincide in time with 
repetitions, prolongations or pauses in speech flow needs to be differentiated from complex tics. 
Tics do not involve the marked speech dysfluency that characterizes a developmental speech 
fluency disorder.
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system
Diseases of the nervous system affecting the anatomical and functional mechanisms for speech 
output can sometimes give rise to speech dysfluency, but are distinguished on examination by the 
presence of positive neurological signs.
Developmental language disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent deficits in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language (spoken 
or signed) are required for diagnosis. Any of the following specific components of language 
skill may be differentially impaired, with relative weaknesses in some and relative strengths 
in others, or impairment may be more consistent across the different component skills:
•	 the ability to decompose words into constituent sounds and mentally manipulate those 
sounds (i.e. phonological awareness);
•	 the ability to use language rules – for example, regarding word endings and how words 
are combined to form sentences (i.e. syntax, morphology or grammar);
•	 the ability to learn, understand and use language to convey the meaning of words and 
sentences (i.e. semantics);
•	 the ability to tell a story or have a conversation (i.e. narrative or conversational discourse);
•	 the ability to understand and use language in social contexts – for example, making 
inferences, understanding verbal humour and resolving ambiguous meaning (i.e. 
pragmatics).
•	 Language abilities are markedly below what would be expected based on age.
•	 The onset of language difficulties occurs during the developmental period – typically 
during early childhood.
•	 Language deficits result in significant limitations in communication, with functional 
impact in daily life at home, school or work.
•	 The language deficits are not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual development, 
autism spectrum disorder, another neurodevelopmental disorder, a sensory impairment, 
or a disease of the nervous system, including the effects of brain injury or infection (e.g. 
due to trauma, stroke, epilepsy or meningitis).
6A01.2
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Specifiers for areas of language impairment
The main areas of language ability currently affected in developmental language disorders should 
be characterized using one of the following specifiers, although these may vary over time:
Developmental language disorder with impairment of receptive and 
expressive language
•	 This specifier should be applied when the ability to learn and understand spoken or signed 
language (i.e. receptive language) is markedly below the expected level for the individual’s 
age, and is accompanied by persistent impairment in the ability to produce and use spoken 
or signed language (i.e. expressive language).
Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly expressive language
•	 This specifier should be applied when the ability to produce and use spoken or signed 
language (i.e. expressive language) is markedly below the expected level for the individual’s 
age, but the ability to understand spoken or signed language (i.e. receptive language) is 
relatively intact.
Developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language
•	 This specifier should be applied when the developmental language disorder is characterized 
by persistent and substantial difficulties with the understanding and use of language in 
social contexts – for example, making inferences, understanding verbal humour and 
resolving ambiguous meaning. Receptive and expressive language skills are relatively 
unimpaired, but pragmatic language abilities are markedly below the expected level for 
the individual’s age, and interfere with functional communication to a greater degree than 
with other components of language (e.g. syntax, semantics). This specifier should not be 
used if the pragmatic language impairment occurs in the context of a diagnosis of autism 
spectrum disorder.
Developmental language disorder with other specified language impairment
•	 This specifier should be applied if the developmental language disorder meets all the 
diagnostic requirements of the disorder but the pattern of deficits in language is not 
adequately characterized by one of the other available specifiers.

Additional clinical features
•	 In typical development, understanding and production of the different components of 
language are tightly correlated and develop in tandem. In developmental language disorder, 
this developmental relationship may be out of step, with differential impairment in any of 
the component language skills.
•	 Many children with developmental language disorder exhibit a discrepancy between 
verbal and nonverbal ability, but this is not a requirement for diagnosis.
•	 Developmental language disorder frequently co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental 
disorders, such as developmental speech sound disorder, developmental learning disorder, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder and developmental 
motor coordination disorder.
•	 Developmental language disorder is often associated with difficulties in peer relationships, 
emotional disturbance and disruptive behaviours, particularly in school-aged children.
•	 Developmental language disorder often runs in families.
•	 Developmental language disorder can be a presenting feature in some individuals with 
specific chromosomal anomalies, including sex chromosome anomalies. Where available, 
chromosome testing can assist in identifying other health risks associated with specific 
underlying chromosomal abnormalities. If a specific chromosomal or other developmental 
anomaly is identified, this should be diagnosed in addition to the developmental 
language disorder.
•	 Regression of language skills once acquired is not a feature of developmental language 
disorder. Reported loss of early first words in the second year of life associated with a 
decline in social and communication behaviours – and, more rarely, loss of language skills 
after 3 years of age – may be a presentation of autism spectrum disorder. Language abilities 
may also be lost due to diseases of the nervous system including acquired brain injury 
from stroke, trauma or encephalopathy with or without overt epilepsy. Concomitant loss of 
physical skills with language abilities may be indicative of a neurodegenerative condition. 
When an underlying neurological cause has been identified, the condition should not be 
diagnosed as developmental language disorder but rather as secondary speech or language 
syndrome, which should be assigned in addition to the appropriate diagnosis for the 
underlying condition.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and in the pace 
at which language skills become firmly established. The majority of preschool-aged children 
who acquire speech later than expected go on to develop normal language abilities. Very 
early delays in language acquisition are therefore not indicative of developmental language 
disorder. However, the absence of single words (or word approximations) by 2 years of age, 
the failure to generate simple two-word phrases by 3 years of age, and language impairments 
that are persistent over time are more likely to indicate developmental language disorder, 
especially in the context of a known family history of language or literacy learning 
problems. By 4 years of age, individual differences in language ability are more stable.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
•	 Pronunciation and language use may vary widely depending on the social, cultural and 
other environmental context (e.g. regional dialects). However, within any typical cultural 
setting, a developmental language disorder is characterized by significant deficits in 
language abilities relative to the person’s same-aged peers in the community. A bilingual 
environment is not a cause of persistent language learning impairment.
Course features
•	 The course of developmental language disorder may vary with the type and severity of 
symptom profile: impairment of receptive and expressive language (compared to those 
with impairment of mainly expressive language) is more likely to be persistent, and is 
associated with subsequent difficulties in reading comprehension.
•	 The particular pattern of language strengths and deficits may change over the course 
of development.
•	 Unlike developmental speech sound and speech fluency disorders, developmental 
language disorder is more likely to be maintained throughout development and into 
adulthood: approximately 75% of individuals diagnosed with developmental language 
disorder in childhood continue to meet the diagnostic requirements for the disorder 
in late adolescence. The impact of these impairments continues to be evident into early 
adulthood as behavioural, social, adaptive and communication problems, often with 
lifelong social consequences.
Developmental presentations
•	 Developmental language disorder emerges early in development, though it can be 
challenging to distinguish typical variations from impairments in language development 
prior to age four. Diagnosis from 4 years of age onwards tends to yield a more stable 
symptom presentation, and is more likely to be persistent.
•	 The prevalence of developmental language disorder among children is estimated at 6–15%, 
but is more common among children with other co-occurring neurodevelopmental 
disorders.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Developmental language disorder appears to affect more boys than girls, though this 
gender ratio varies across clinical and population-based samples (from 1.3:1 to 6:1).
•	 Boys appear to be more likely than girls to experience co-occurring developmental 
language and developmental speech sound disorders.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may exhibit delays in language onset, or 
development or impairment in language abilities, accompanied by generalized impairment in 
intellectual and adaptive behaviour functioning. Developmental language disorder can occur with 
varying levels of intellectual ability. If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual 
development are met and language abilities are significantly below what would be expected based on 
the general level of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with developmental speech sound disorder and developmental speech 
fluency disorder
Like developmental language disorder with impairment in mainly expressive language, 
developmental speech sound disorder and developmental speech fluency disorder can result in 
reduced intelligibility that significantly affects communication. Developmental speech sound 
disorder is characterized by errors of pronunciation that are outside the limits of normal variation 
for chronological developmental age. Developmental speech fluency disorder is characterized by 
disruption of the normal rhythmic flow and rate of speech. In contrast, developmental language 
disorder is characterized by persistent difficulties in the acquisition, understanding, production or 
use of language.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with delayed language development. The 
extent of functional language impairment, which refers to the capacity of the individual to use 
language for instrumental purposes (e.g. to express personal needs and desires), should be coded 
using the autism spectrum disorder functional language impairment specifier rather than using a 
separate diagnosis of developmental language disorder. Moreover, pragmatic language impairment 
is a characteristic feature of autism spectrum disorder even when other aspects of receptive and 
expressive speech are intact. Autism spectrum disorder is differentiated from developmental 
language disorder by the presence of additional impairments in social reciprocity as well as restricted, 
repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. Unlike individuals with autism spectrum disorder, individuals 
with developmental language disorder are usually able to initiate and respond appropriately to 
social and emotional cues and to share interests with others, and do not typically exhibit restricted, 
repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. An additional diagnosis of developmental language disorder 
should not be assigned to individuals with autism spectrum disorder based solely on pragmatic 
language impairment. However, both diagnoses may be assigned if there are additional specific 
impairments in semantic, syntactic and phonological development.
Boundary with developmental learning disorder
Persistent deficits in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language in developmental 
language disorder may lead to academic learning difficulties, especially in literacy – including word 
reading, comprehension and written output. If all diagnostic requirements for both developmental 
language disorder and developmental learning disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with selective mutism
Selective mutism is characterized by consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child demonstrates 
adequate language competence in specific social situations (typically at home) but predictably fails to 
speak in others (typically at school). In contrast, language difficulties associated with developmental 
language disorder are apparent in all settings. However, selective mutism and developmental 
language disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental speech and language disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system and sequelae of brain injury 
or infection
Language impairment may result from brain damage due to stroke, trauma, infection (e.g. meningitis/
encephalitis), developmental encephalopathy with or without overt epilepsy, or syndromes of 
regression (e.g. Landau-Kleffner syndrome or acquired epileptic aphasia). When language difficulties 
are a specific focus of clinical attention, a diagnosis of secondary speech or language syndrome 
should be assigned in addition to the associated medical condition.
Boundary with oral language delay or impairment due to hearing impairment
All children presenting with language impairment should have an assessment for hearing impairment 
because language delay may be better accounted for by hearing impairment. Very young children 
with hearing impairment usually compensate for lack of oral language by using nonverbal modes 
of communication (e.g. gestures, facial expressions, eye gaze). However, presence of hearing loss 
does not preclude a diagnosis of developmental language disorder if the language problems are 
disproportionate relative to the severity of hearing loss. Developmental language disorder can be 
assigned to children whose primary communication modality is through signing if exposure to 
and opportunity to learn sign language has been adequate and the other features of the disorder 
are present as they apply to sign language.
Boundary with other medical conditions involving loss of acquired language skills
When loss of acquired language skills occurs as a result of another medical condition (e.g. a stroke), 
and language difficulties are a specific focus of clinical attention, a diagnosis of secondary speech 
or language syndrome should be assigned in addition to the associated medical condition rather 
than a diagnosis of developmental language disorder.
Other specified developmental speech or language disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent difficulties in understanding or producing speech or language or in using 
language in context for the purposes of communication that are not better accounted 
for by developmental speech sound disorder, developmental speech fluency disorder, 
developmental language disorder or autism spectrum disorder are required for diagnosis.
•	 The speech or language difficulties are persistent over time.
•	 The onset of the speech or language difficulties occurs during the developmental period, 
and speech or language abilities in the affected areas are markedly below what would be 
expected based on age.
•	 The speech or language difficulties result in significant impairment in social communication, 
or in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning.
•	 The speech or language difficulties are not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual 
development, a disease of the nervous system, a sensory impairment or a structural 
abnormality.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Autism spectrum disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social 
interactions that are outside the expected range of typical functioning based on the 
individual’s age and level of intellectual development are required for diagnosis. Specific 
manifestations of these deficits vary according to chronological age, verbal and intellectual 
ability, and disorder severity. Manifestations may include limitations in the following:
•	 understanding of, interest in, or inappropriate responses to the verbal or nonverbal social 
communications of others;
•	 integration of spoken language with typical complimentary nonverbal cues, such as eye 
contact, gestures, facial expressions and body language (these nonverbal behaviours may 
also be reduced in frequency or intensity);
•	 understanding and use of language in social contexts and ability to initiate and sustain 
reciprocal social conversations;
•	 social awareness, leading to behaviour that is not appropriately modulated according to 
the social context;
•	 ability to imagine and respond to the feelings, emotional states and attitudes of others;
•	 mutual sharing of interests;
•	 ability to make and sustain typical peer relationships.
•	 Persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities 
that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual’s age and sociocultural context are 
an essential component. These may include:
•	 lack of adaptability to new experiences and circumstances, with associated distress, that 
can be evoked by trivial changes to a familiar environment or in response to unanticipated 
events;
•	 inflexible adherence to particular routines – for example, these may be geographical, such 
as following familiar routes, or may require precise timing such as mealtimes or transport;
•	 excessive adherence to rules (e.g. when playing games);
•	 excessive and persistent ritualized patterns of behaviour (e.g. preoccupation with lining 
up or sorting objects in a particular way) that serve no apparent external purpose;
•	 repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. 
rocking), atypical gait (e.g. walking on tiptoes), unusual hand or finger movements and 
posturing (these behaviours are particularly common during early childhood);
•	 persistent preoccupation with one or more special interests, parts of objects or specific 
types of stimuli (including media), or an unusually strong attachment to particular objects 
(excluding typical comforters);
•	 lifelong excessive and persistent hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli or 
unusual interest in a sensory stimulus, which may include actual or anticipated sounds, 
light, textures (especially clothing and food), odours and tastes, heat, cold or pain.
•	 The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period – typically in early 
childhood – but characteristic symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when 
social demands exceed limited capacities.
6A02
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. Some individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder are able to function adequately in many contexts through exceptional 
effort, such that their deficits may not be apparent to others. A diagnosis of autism spectrum 
disorder is still appropriate in such cases.
Specifiers for characterizing features within the autism spectrum
These specifiers enable the identification of co-occurring limitations in intellectual and functional 
language abilities, which are important factors in the appropriate individualization of support, 
selection of interventions and treatment planning for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. A 
specifier is also provided for loss of previously acquired skills, which is a feature of the developmental 
history of a small proportion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
Co-occurring disorder of intellectual development
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may exhibit limitations in intellectual abilities. If present, 
a separate diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development should be assigned, using the appropriate 
category to designate severity (i.e. mild, moderate, severe, profound, provisional). Because social 
deficits are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder, the assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part 
of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development should place greater emphasis 
on the intellectual, conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills.
If no co-occurring diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development is present, the following specifier 
for the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis should be applied:
• without disorder of intellectual development.
If there is a co-occurring diagnosis of disorder of intellectual development, the following specifier for 
the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis should be applied, in addition to the appropriate diagnostic 
code for the co-occurring disorder of intellectual development:
• with disorder of intellectual development.
Degree of functional language impairment
The degree of impairment in functional language (spoken or signed) should be designated with a 
second specifier. Functional language refers to the capacity of the individual to use language for 
instrumental purposes (e.g. to express personal needs and desires). This specifier is intended to 
reflect primarily the verbal and nonverbal expressive language deficits present in some individuals 
with autism spectrum disorder, and not the pragmatic language deficits that are a core feature of 
autism spectrum disorder.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The following specifiers should be applied to indicate the extent of functional language impairment 
(spoken or signed) relative to the individual’s age:
• with mild or no impairment of functional language
• with impaired functional language (i.e. not able to use more than single words or simple 
phrases)
• with complete, or almost complete, absence of functional language.
Table 6.5 shows the diagnostic codes corresponding to the categories that result from the application 
of the specifiers for co-occurring disorder of intellectual development and degree of functional 
language impairment.

Loss of previously acquired skills
A small proportion of individuals with autism spectrum disorder may present with a loss of 
previously acquired skills. This regression typically occurs during the second year of life and most 
often involves language use and social responsiveness. Loss of previously acquired skills is rarely 
observed after 3 years of age. If it occurs after age 3, it is more likely to involve loss of cognitive and 
adaptive skills (e.g. loss of bowel and bladder control, impaired sleep), regression of language and 
social abilities, and increasing emotional and behavioural disturbances.
There are two alternative specifiers to denote whether or not loss of previously acquired skills is an 
aspect of the clinical history, where x corresponds to the final digit shown in Table 6.5:
• 6A02.x0 without loss of previously acquired skills
• 6A02.x1 with loss of previously acquired skills.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Common symptom presentations of autism spectrum disorder in young children are 
parental or caregiver concerns about intellectual or other developmental delays (e.g. 
problems in language and motor coordination). When there is no significant impairment 
of intellectual functioning, clinical services may only be sought later (e.g. due to behaviour 
or social problems when starting school). In middle childhood, there may be prominent 
symptoms of anxiety, including social anxiety disorder, school refusal and specific phobia. 
During adolescence and adulthood, depressive disorders are often a presenting feature.
•	 Co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder with other mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders is common across the lifespan. In a substantial proportion 
of cases – particularly in adolescence and adulthood – it is a co-occurring disorder that 
first brings an individual with autism spectrum disorder to clinical attention.
•	 Pragmatic language difficulties may manifest as an overly literal understanding of others’ 
speech, speech that lacks normal prosody and emotional tone and therefore appears 
monotonous, lack of awareness of the appropriateness of their choice of language in 
particular social contexts, or pedantic precision in the use of language.
•	 Social naivety, especially during adolescence, can lead to exploitation by others – a risk that 
may be enhanced by the use of social media without adequate supervision.
•	 Profiles of specific cognitive skills in autism spectrum disorder as measured by standardized 
assessments may show striking and unusual patterns of strengths and weaknesses that 
are highly variable from individual to individual. These deficits can affect learning and 
adaptive functioning to a greater extent than would be predicted from the overall scores 
on measures of verbal and nonverbal intelligence.
•	 Self-injurious behaviours (e.g. hitting one’s face, head banging) occur more often in 
individuals with co-occurring disorder of intellectual development.
•	 Some young individuals with autism spectrum disorder – especially those with a co-
occurring disorder of intellectual development – develop epilepsy or seizures during 
early childhood with a second increase in prevalence during adolescence. Catatonic states 
have also been described. A number of medical disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, 
chromosomal abnormalities including fragile X syndrome, cerebral palsy, early-onset 
epileptic encephalopathies and neurofibromatosis are associated with autism spectrum 
disorder with or without a co-occurring disorder of intellectual development. Genomic 
deletions, duplications and other genetic abnormalities are increasingly described in 
individuals with autism spectrum disorder, some of which may be important for genetic 
counselling. Prenatal exposure to valproate is also associated with an increased risk of 
autism spectrum disorder.
•	 Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder are capable of functioning adequately 
by making an exceptional effort to compensate for their symptoms during childhood, 
adolescence or adulthood. Such sustained effort, which may be more typical of affected 
females, can have a deleterious impact on mental health and well-being.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with normality (threshold)
Social interaction skills
Typically developing individuals vary in the pace and extent to which they acquire and master skills 
of reciprocal social interaction and social communication. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder 
should only be considered if there is marked and persistent deviation from the expected range of 
abilities and behaviours in these domains given the individual’s age, level of intellectual functioning 
and sociocultural context. Some individuals may exhibit limited social interaction due to shyness 
(i.e. feelings of awkwardness or fear in new situations or with unfamiliar people) or behavioural 
inhibition (i.e. being slow to approach or to “warm up” to new people and situations). Limited social 
interactions in shy or behaviourally inhibited children, adolescents or adults are not indicative of 
autism spectrum disorder. Shyness is differentiated from autism spectrum disorder by evidence of 
adequate social communication behaviours in familiar situations.
Social communication skills
Children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and the pace at which 
their speech and language become firmly established. Most children with early language delay 
eventually acquire similar language skills to those of their same-age peers. Early language delay 
alone is not strongly indicative of autism spectrum disorder unless there is also evidence of 
limited motivation for social communication and limited interaction skills. An essential feature of 
autism spectrum disorder is persistent impairment in the ability to understand and use language 
appropriately for social communication.
Repetitive and stereotyped behaviours
Many children go through phases of repetitive play and highly focused interests as a part of typical 
development. Unless there is also evidence of impaired reciprocal social interaction and social 
communication, patterns of behaviour characterized by repetition, routine or restricted interests 
are not by themselves indicative of autism spectrum disorder.
Course features
•	 Although autism spectrum disorder can present clinically at all ages, including during 
adulthood, it is a lifelong disorder, the manifestations and impact of which are likely to 
vary according to age, intellectual and language abilities, co-occurring conditions and 
environmental context.
•	 Restricted and repetitive behaviours persist over time. Specifically, repetitive sensorimotor 
behaviours appear to be common, consistent and potentially severe. During the school-
age years and adolescence, these repetitive sensorimotor behaviours begin to lessen in 
intensity and number. Insistence on sameness, which is less prevalent, appears to develop 
during preschool and worsen over time.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Developmental presentations
Infancy
Characteristic features may emerge during infancy, although they may only be recognized as 
indicative of autism spectrum disorder in retrospect. It is usually possible to make the diagnosis of 
autism spectrum disorder during the preschool period (up to 4 years of age), especially in children 
exhibiting generalized developmental delay. Plateauing of social communication and language skills 
and failure to progress in their development is not uncommon. The loss of early words and social 
responsiveness – i.e. a true regression – with an onset between 1 and 2 years of age is unusual but 
significant, and rarely occurs after the third year of life. In these cases, the with loss of previously 
acquired skills specifier should be applied.
Preschool
In preschool-aged children, indicators of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis often include 
avoidance of mutual eye contact, resistance to physical affection, a lack of social imaginary play, 
language that is delayed in onset or is precocious but not used for social conversation; social 
withdrawal, obsessive or repetitive preoccupations, and a lack of social interaction with peers 
characterized by parallel play or disinterest. Sensory sensitivities to everyday sounds, or to foods, 
may overshadow the underlying social communication deficits.
Middle childhood
In children with autism spectrum disorder without a disorder of intellectual development, social 
adjustment difficulties outside the home may not be detected until middle childhood (commonly at 
school entry) or during adolescence, when social communication problems lead to social isolation 
from peers. Resistance to engage in unfamiliar experiences and marked reactions to even minor 
change in routines are typical. Furthermore, excessive focus on detail and rigidity of behaviour and 
thinking may be significant. Symptoms of anxiety may become evident at this stage of development.
Adolescence
By adolescence, the capacity to cope with increasing social complexity in peer relationships at a time 
of increasingly demanding academic expectations is often overwhelmed. In some individuals with 
autism spectrum disorder, the underlying social communication deficits may be overshadowed by 
the symptoms of co-occurring mental and behavioural disorders. Depressive symptoms are often 
a presenting feature.
Adulthood
In adulthood, the capacity for those with autism spectrum disorder to cope with social relationships 
can become increasingly challenged, and clinical presentation may occur when social demands 
overwhelm the capacity to compensate. Presenting problems in adulthood may represent reactions 
to social isolation or the social consequences of inappropriate behaviour. Compensation strategies 
may be sufficient to sustain dyadic relationships, but are usually inadequate in social groups. Special 
interests, and focused attention, may benefit some individuals in education and employment. 
Work environments may have to be tailored to the capacities of the individual. A first diagnosis 
in adulthood may be precipitated by a breakdown in domestic or work relationships. In autism 
spectrum disorder there is always a history of early childhood social communication and relationship 
difficulties, although this may only be apparent in retrospect.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Cultural variation exists in norms of social communication and reciprocal social 
interactions, as well as interests and activities. Therefore, signs of impairment in 
functioning may differ depending on cultural context. For example, in some societies it 
may be normative for children may avoid direct eye contact out of deference, which should 
not be misinterpreted as impairment in social interaction.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Males are four times more likely than females to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
•	 Females diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are more frequently diagnosed with 
co-occurring disorders of intellectual development than males, suggesting that less severe 
presentations may go undetected. Females tend to demonstrate fewer restricted, repetitive 
interests and behaviours.
•	 During middle childhood, gender differences in presentation differentially affect 
functioning. Boys may act out with reactive aggression or other behavioural symptoms 
when challenged or frustrated. Girls tend to withdraw socially, and react with emotional 
changes to their social adjustment difficulties.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Autism spectrum disorder may be diagnosed in individuals with disorders of intellectual 
development if deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social 
interactions are greater than would be expected based on the individual’s level of intellectual 
functioning, and if the other diagnostic requirements for autism spectrum disorder are also met. 
In these circumstances, both autism spectrum disorder and the disorder of intellectual development 
should be assigned, and the with disorder of intellectual development specifier should be applied with 
the autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. Because autism spectrum disorder inherently involves 
social deficits, assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring disorder 
of intellectual development should place greater emphasis on intellectual functioning and the 
conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills. The diagnosis 
of autism spectrum disorder in individuals with severe and profound disorders of intellectual 
development is particularly difficult, and requires in-depth and longitudinal assessments. However, 
the diagnosis may be assigned if skills in social reciprocity and communication are significantly 
impaired relative to the individual’s general level of intellectual ability.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Boundary with developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly 
pragmatic language
Individuals with developmental language disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language 
exhibit language deficits involving the ability to understand and use language in social contexts (i.e. 
with pragmatic language impairment). Unlike individuals with autism spectrum disorder, individuals 
with developmental language disorder are usually able to initiate and respond appropriately to 
social and emotional cues and to share interests with others, and do not typically exhibit restricted, 
repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. An additional diagnosis of developmental language disorder 
should not be assigned to individuals with autism spectrum disorder based solely on pragmatic 
language impairment. The other forms of developmental language disorder (i.e. with impairment 
of receptive and expressive language or with impairment of receptive and expressive language) may 
be assigned in conjunction with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder if language abilities are 
markedly below what would be expected based on age and level of intellectual functioning.
Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorder
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may be reluctant to participate in tasks requiring 
complex motor coordination skills, such as ball sports, which is better accounted for by a lack of 
interest rather than any specific deficits in motor coordination. However, developmental motor 
coordination disorder and autism spectrum disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses may be 
assigned if warranted.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Specific abnormalities in attention (e.g. being overly focused or easily distracted), impulsivity 
and physical hyperactivity are often observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder. 
However, individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit the persistent 
deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions or 
the persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that 
are the defining features of autism spectrum disorder. However, autism spectrum disorder and 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the 
diagnostic requirements for each are met. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms may 
sometimes dominate the clinical presentation such that some autism spectrum disorder symptoms 
are less apparent.
Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder
Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently 
purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period. 
Although such stereotyped movements are typical in autism spectrum disorder, if they are severe 
enough to require additional clinical attention – for example, because of self-injury – a co-occurring 
diagnosis of stereotyped movement disorder may be warranted.
Boundary with schizophrenia
The onset of schizophrenia may be associated with prominent social withdrawal, which is either 
preceded by or results in social impairments that may resemble social deficits seen in autism 
spectrum disorder. However, unlike autism spectrum disorder, the onset of schizophrenia is 
typically in adolescence or early adulthood, and is extremely rare prior to puberty. Schizophrenia 
is differentiated on the basis of the presence of psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations), 
as well as a lack of restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities 
during early childhood typical of autism spectrum disorder.
Boundary with schizotypal disorder
Interpersonal difficulties seen in autism spectrum disorder may share some features of schizotypal 
disorder, such as poor rapport with others and social withdrawal. However, autism spectrum 
disorder is also characterized by restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests 
or activities.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with social anxiety disorder
Social anxiety disorder is associated with limited engagement in social interaction due to marked 
and excessive fear or anxiety about negatively evaluated by others. Typically, when interacting with 
familiar others or in social situations that do not provoke significant anxiety, there is no evidence 
of impairment. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may experience social anxiety, but 
they also exhibit more pervasive deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and 
reciprocal social interactions than are typically observed in social anxiety disorder. Persistent 
restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities are not features of 
social anxiety disorder.
Boundary with selective mutism
Selective mutism is characterized by normal use of language and patterns of social communication in 
specific environments (such as the home), but not in others (such as at school). In autism spectrum 
disorder, a reluctance to communicate may be observed in some social circumstances, but deficits 
in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions and persistent 
restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities are evident across 
all situations and contexts.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by persistent repetitive thoughts, images, or 
impulses/urges (i.e. obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviours (i.e. compulsions) that the individual 
feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, to reduce anxiety or to 
achieve a sense of “completeness”. These symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from restricted, 
repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are characteristic of autism 
spectrum disorder. Unlike those with autism spectrum disorder, it is more common for individuals 
with obsessive-compulsive disorder consciously to resist their impulsive urges to perform compulsive 
behaviours (e.g. by performing alternate tasks), though adolescents and adults with autism spectrum 
disorder may also try to suppress specific behaviours that they realize are socially undesirable. 
Autism spectrum disorder can also be distinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder by its 
characteristic deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social 
interactions, which are not features of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Boundary with reactive attachment disorder
Reactive attachment disorder is characterized by inhibited emotionally withdrawn behaviour 
exhibited towards adult caregivers, including a failure to approach a discriminated, preferred 
attachment figure for comfort, support, protection or nurturance. The diagnosis of reactive 
attachment disorder requires evidence of a history of severe neglect or maltreatment by the primary 
caregiver or other forms of severe social deprivation (e.g. certain types of institutionalization). Some 
individuals reared under conditions of severe deprivation in institutional settings exhibit autistic-like 
features, including difficulties in social reciprocity and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns 
of behaviour, interests or activities. Also referred to as “quasi-autism”, affected individuals are 
differentiated from those with autism spectrum disorder based on significant improvement of 
autism-like features when the child is moved to a more nurturing environment. Differentiation 
between reactive attachment disorder and autism spectrum disorder is difficult when no reliable 
evidence is available of intact social and communicative development prior to the onset of abuse 
or neglect.
Boundary with disinhibited social engagement disorder
Disinhibited social engagement disorder is characterized by persistent indiscriminate social 
approaches to unfamiliar adults and peers, a pattern of behaviour that may also be seen in some 
children with autism spectrum disorder. The diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder 
requires evidence of a history of severe neglect or maltreatment by the primary caregiver or other 
forms of severe social deprivation (e.g. certain types of institutionalization). As in reactive attachment 
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
disorder, disinhibited social engagement disorder may be associated with generalized deficits in 
social understanding and social communication. Although they may occur, restricted, repetitive 
and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities are not typical features of disinhibited 
social engagement disorder. Evidence of a significant reduction in symptoms when the child is 
provided a more nurturing environment suggests that disinhibited social engagement disorder is 
the appropriate diagnosis.
Boundary with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder
Individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder sometimes restrict their food intake 
based on food’s sensory characteristics such as smell, taste, temperature, texture or appearance. 
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also restrict intake of certain foods because of their 
sensory characteristics or because of inflexible adherence to particular routines. However, autism 
spectrum disorder is also characterized by persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social 
communication and reciprocal social interactions and persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible 
patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are unrelated to food. If a pattern of restricted eating 
in an individual with autism spectrum disorder has caused significant weight loss or other health 
consequences, or is specifically associated with significant functional impairment, an additional 
diagnosis of avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a pattern of markedly noncompliant, defiant 
and disobedient disruptive behaviour that is not typical for individuals of comparable age and 
developmental level. Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder do not exhibit the social 
communication deficits or restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or 
activities that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder. However, oppositional or “demand 
avoidant” behaviour may be prominent in some children with autism spectrum disorder, whether or 
not they have accompanying intellectual or functional language impairments, and may sometimes be 
the presenting feature in school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder. Disruptive behaviour 
with aggressive outbursts (explosive rages) may also be a prominent feature of autism spectrum 
disorder. Among individuals with autism spectrum disorder, such outbursts are often associated 
with a specific trigger (e.g. a change in routine, aversive sensory stimulation, anxiety or rigidity 
when the individual’s thoughts or behaviour sequences are interrupted) rather than reflecting an 
intention to be defiant, provocative or spiteful, as is more typical of oppositional defiant disorder.
Boundary with personality disorder
Personality disorder is a pervasive disturbance in how an individual experiences and thinks about the 
self, others and the world, manifested in maladaptive patterns of cognition, emotional experience, 
emotional expression and behaviour. The maladaptive patterns are relatively inflexible, manifesting 
across a range of personal and social situations; relatively stable over time; and of long duration. They 
are associated with significant problems in psychosocial functioning that are particularly evident in 
interpersonal relationships. The difficulties some individuals with autism spectrum disorder exhibit 
in initiating and maintaining relationships because of their limited skills in social communication 
and reciprocal social interactions may resemble those seen in some individuals with personality 
disorder. However, unlike autism spectrum disorder, persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible 
patterns of behaviour, interests or activities with onset in early childhood are not characteristic 
features of personality disorder.	
Boundary with primary tics and tic disorders including Tourette syndrome
Sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic and recurrent movements or vocalizations occur in primary tics and 
tic disorders, which may resemble repetitive and stereotyped motor movements in autism spectrum 
disorder. Unlike autism spectrum disorder, tics in primary tics and tic disorders tend to be less 
stereotyped, are often accompanied by premonitory sensory urges, last for a shorter period, tend 
to emerge later in life, and are not experienced by the individual as soothing.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Autism spectrum disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with diseases of the nervous system and other medical conditions 
classified elsewhere
Loss of previously acquired skills in language and social communication in the second year of life 
is reported in some children with autism spectrum disorder, but this rarely occurs after the age of 
3 years. Diseases of the nervous system and other medical conditions associated with regression 
(e.g. acquired epileptic aphasia or Landau-Kleffner syndrome, autoimmune encephalitis, Rett 
syndrome) are differentiated from autism spectrum disorder with loss of previously acquired skills 
on the basis of an early history of relatively normal social and language development, and by the 
characteristic neurological features of these disorders that are not typical of autism spectrum disorder.
Boundary with secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome
Autistic features may become manifest in the context of acquired medical conditions, such as 
encephalitis. Identifying accurately whether the symptoms are secondary to another medical 
condition or represent the exacerbation of pre-existing autism spectrum disorder may have 
implications for both immediate management and prognosis. When autistic symptoms are 
attributable to another medical condition, a diagnosis of secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome 
rather than autism spectrum disorder may be assigned.
Developmental learning disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of significant limitations in learning academic skills of reading, writing or 
arithmetic, resulting in a skill level markedly below what would be expected based on age is 
required for diagnosis. Limitations in learning are manifest, despite appropriate academic 
instruction in the relevant areas. The limitations may be restricted to a single component of 
a skill (e.g. an inability to master basic numeracy, or to decode single words accurately and 
fluently) or may affect all reading, writing and arithmetic. Ideally, limitations are measured 
using appropriately normed and standardized tests.
•	 Onset of the limitations typically occurs during the early school years, but in some 
individuals may not be identified until later in life, including into adulthood, when 
performance demands related to learning exceed limited capacities.
•	 The limitations are not attributable to external factors, such as economic or environmental 
disadvantage, or lack of access to educational opportunities.
•	 The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual 
development or another neurodevelopmental disorder, or by another condition such as a 
motor disorder or a sensory disorder of vision or hearing.
•	 The learning difficulties result in significant impairment in the individual’s academic, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
6A03
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Specifiers for area of learning impairment
Specifiers should be applied to indicate which academic skills are significantly impaired at the 
time of assessment. Multiple specifiers may be used to reflect limitations in multiple skills.
Impairment in reading
•	 Learning difficulties are manifested in impairments in reading skills such as word reading 
accuracy, reading fluency or reading comprehension.
Impairment in written expression
•	 Learning difficulties are manifested in impairments in writing skills such as spelling 
accuracy, grammar and punctuation accuracy, or organization and cohesion of ideas 
in writing.
Impairment in mathematics
•	 Learning difficulties are manifested in impairments in mathematical skills such as number 
sense, memorization of number facts, accurate calculation, fluent calculation or accurate 
mathematic reasoning.
Other specified impairment of learning
•	 Learning difficulties are manifested in impairments in learning and performance of 
specific academic skills that are not adequately characterized by one of the other available 
specifiers.

Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Individuals with developmental learning disorder typically show impairments in 
various underlying psychological processes that may include phonological processing, 
orthographic processing, memory (including working memory), executive functions 
(including inhibitory control, set-shifting, planning), learning and automatizing symbols 
(e.g. visual, alphanumeric), perceptual-motor integration and speed of processing 
information. Deficits in these psychological processes are presumed to underlie a child’s 
ability to learn academic skills. However, the precise relationship between psychological 
processes and outcomes related to learning capacity is not yet sufficiently understood to 
allow an accurate and clinically useful classification based on these underlying processes.
•	 Developmental learning disorder commonly co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental 
disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, developmental motor 
coordination disorder, developmental language disorder and autism spectrum disorder.
•	 Many individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties self-
regulating attention that are not sufficiently severe to warrant a separate diagnosis. 
Persistent difficulties with self-regulated attention can have deleterious effects on academic 
outcomes, and may impede response to intervention or support.
•	 Some individuals with developmental learning disorder may be able to sustain seemingly 
adequate levels of key academic skills by using compensatory strategies or through 
devoting extraordinarily high levels of effort or time, or through the provision of unusually 
high levels of support. However, as demands for efficiency in key academic skills increase 
and exceed capabilities (e.g. in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy detailed reports 
for a tight deadline, heavier academic coursework as in high school/secondary school, 
postsecondary education or professional training), the underlying learning difficulties 
tend to become more fully apparent.
•	 Ideally, determination of the presence of developmental learning disorder includes 
assessment of academic achievement using standardized, appropriately normed 
instruments. However, a child’s score on a single test measuring a particular academic skill 
is not sufficient to distinguish disorder from normality. Achievement scores may vary as a 
result of the technical properties of the specific test being used, the testing conditions and a 
variety of other variables, and also can vary substantially over the individual’s development 
and life-course. Therefore, the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder should also 
consider various sources of evidence regarding the child’s capacity for learning outside the 
formal testing situation.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The age of acquisition of academic skills varies, and later acquisition of a particular academic 
skill compared to same-age peers does not necessarily indicate the presence of a disorder. 
Developmental learning disorder is distinguished by persistent difficulty in learning the 
particular academic skills over time in spite of adequate educational opportunities, and by 
the severity of the impairment caused by the learning difficulty.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Course features
•	 Deficits in reading, mathematics and written expression identified in childhood typically 
persist through adolescence and into adulthood. These deficits may negatively affect a 
child’s academic achievement, increase the likelihood of school dropout, and contribute to 
unemployment (or underemployment) in adulthood – particularly if left untreated. Along 
with school dropout, significant co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk of 
poor mental health outcomes, including suicide.
•	 The specific impairments associated with developmental learning disorder vary with 
developmental stage and learning abilities, severity of deficits, complexity of tasks, 
presence of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, and the 
availability of support.
•	 Developmental learning disorder is also associated with heightened risk of suicidal ideation 
and suicide attempts across the lifespan.
Developmental presentations
•	 Developmental learning disorder is most often diagnosed during elementary school years 
because difficulties in reading, mathematics and/or writing typically only become evident 
when these topics are taught formally. Some individuals, however, may not be diagnosed 
until later in development, including in adulthood. Premorbid impairments, such as in 
language, counting or rhyming, or fine motor control tend to be evident in early childhood 
prior to the diagnosis of developmental learning disorder.
•	 The prevalence of developmental learning disorder across all areas of impairment 
(i.e. reading, written expression and mathematics) is estimated to affect between 5% and 
15% of school-aged children. Prevalence among adults is unknown, but is estimated at 
approximately 4%. The prevalence of developmental learning disorder for specific academic 
areas among school-aged children is variable (reading is estimated at 5–17%; mathematics 
at 6–7%; written expression at 7–15%).
•	 Children with developmental learning disorder frequently exhibit co-occurring symptoms 
of depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and externalizing behaviour 
disorders, which may make it more difficult to assess their learning impairments.
•	 Children with developmental learning disorder with impairment in one academic area are 
more likely to have co-occurring impairments in other areas.
Culture-related features
•	 Developmental learning disorder with impairment in reading can be manifested differently 
by language. For example, in English, the presentation involves inaccurate and slow reading 
of single words. In other languages with more direct mapping between sounds and letters 
(e.g. Spanish, German) and non-alphabetic languages (e.g. Chinese, Japanese), the typical 
presentation is slow but accurate reading.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Developmental learning disorder is more common among boys. Boys may be more likely 
to be clinically referred because of greater prevalence of co-occurring attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder or problematic externalizing behaviours.
•	 Among community samples, the gender ratio of males to females ranges from 1.5:1 to 3:1. 
This ratio appears greater in clinical samples (estimated at 6:1).
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Individuals with disorders of intellectual development often present with limitations in academic 
achievement by virtue of significant generalized deficits in intellectual functioning. It is therefore 
difficult to establish the co-occurring presence of a developmental learning disorder in individuals 
with a disorder of intellectual development. Developmental learning disorder should only 
be diagnosed in the presence of a disorder of intellectual development when the limitations in 
learning are significantly in excess of those usually expected for the individual’s level of intellectual 
functioning.
Boundary with developmental language disorder
Persistent deficits in the acquisition, understanding, production or use of language in developmental 
language disorder may lead to academic learning difficulties, especially in literacy – including word 
reading and written output. If all diagnostic requirements for both developmental language disorder 
and developmental learning disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Many individuals with developmental learning disorder have marked difficulties in self-regulating 
attention. However, unlike in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the limitations in acquisition 
of academic skills in developmental learning disorder are not solely a function of a child’s ability to 
sustain attention on academic tasks or modulate their activity level appropriately. The co-occurrence 
of developmental learning disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is common, and 
both disorders may be diagnosed if diagnostic requirements are met.
Boundary with sensory impairments
Developmental learning disorder must be differentiated from learning difficulties that arise because 
of sensory impairments in vision or hearing. However, individuals with vision and hearing problems 
for which appropriate accommodations have been made may also have co-occurring developmental 
learning disorder.
Boundary with neurodegenerative diseases
Developmental learning disorder is distinguished from learning difficulties that occur after the 
developmental period due to neurodegenerative diseases or to injury (e.g. traumatic brain injury) 
by the fact that in the latter conditions there is a loss of previously acquired academic skills and 
previous capacity for learning new skills.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental learning disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Developmental motor coordination disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Significant delay in the acquisition of gross or fine motor skills and impairment in the 
execution of coordinated motor skills manifesting as clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy 
of motor performance is required for diagnosis.
•	 Coordinated motor skills are markedly below those expected on the basis of age.
•	 Onset of coordinated motor skill difficulties occurs during the developmental period, and 
is typically apparent from early childhood.
•	 Coordinated motor skills difficulties cause significant and persistent limitations in 
activities of daily living, schoolwork, vocation and leisure activities, or other important 
areas of functioning.
•	 Difficulties with coordinated motor skills are not better accounted for by a disease of 
the nervous system, disease of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue, sensory 
impairment or a disorder of intellectual development.
Additional clinical features
•	 Young children with developmental motor coordination disorder may be delayed in 
achieving motor milestones (e.g. sitting, crawling, walking), although many achieve 
typical early motor milestones. Acquisition of skills such as negotiating stairs, pedalling, 
buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, tying shoes and using zippers may be delayed or 
pose difficulties. Even when a given skill is achieved, movement execution may appear 
awkward, slow or less precise than that of peers. Children may drop things, stumble, bump 
into obstacles or fall more frequently than peers.
•	 Developmental motor coordination disorder may affect primarily gross motor functioning, 
primarily fine motor functioning or both aspects of motor functioning.
•	 Manifestations of developmental motor coordination disorder typically persist into adult 
life. Older children and adults with developmental motor coordination disorder may be 
slow or inaccurate in a variety of activities requiring fine or gross motor skills, such as team 
sports (especially ball sports), bicycling, handwriting, assembling models or other objects, 
or drawing maps.
•	 Other neurodevelopmental disorders commonly co-occur with developmental motor 
coordination disorder. In addition to disorders of intellectual development, attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, this also includes developmental 
speech sound disorder (particularly difficulties with articulation), developmental 
language disorder and developmental learning disorder. Although the presence of other 
neurodevelopmental disorders does not preclude the diagnosis of developmental motor 
coordination disorder, these disorders may also interfere with the execution of activities 
6A04
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental motor coordination disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

of daily living, schoolwork, and vocational and leisure activities that require coordinated 
motor skills. Co-occurrence therefore complicates assessment and requires clinical 
judgement in attributing limitations in activities that require coordinated motor skills to a 
specific diagnosis.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 There is considerable variation in the age of acquisition of many motor skills and a lack of 
stability of measurement in early childhood. Onset of developmental motor coordination 
disorder typically occurs during the early developmental period, but differentiation from 
typical development before the age of 4 years is difficult due to the variability in motor 
development and skill acquisition throughout early childhood. Therefore, the diagnosis of 
developmental motor coordination disorder is usually not made before the age of 5 years.
•	 Performance of motor skills should ideally be assessed using appropriately normed, 
individually administered, culturally appropriate standardized tests of gross and fine 
motor coordination, and should include evaluation of the impact of symptoms at home 
and at school (or, in adults, in the workplace). Key features for assessment are persistence 
of motor skill impairment over time, severity of impairment and pervasiveness of impact 
on functioning.
•	 Developmental motor coordination disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is most common (an estimated 50% of 
cases). Developmental speech and language disorder, developmental learning disorder 
(most often with impairments in reading and written expression) and autism spectrum 
disorder also commonly co-occur with developmental motor coordination disorder.
Course features
•	 Though there may be improvement in symptoms over time, with some children 
experiencing a complete remission of symptoms, the course of developmental motor 
coordination disorder is typically chronic, persisting into adolescence and adulthood in 
up to 50–70% of cases. The persistence of developmental motor coordination disorder into 
adulthood often affects social and psychological functioning as well as physical health.
•	 The presence of other co-occurring neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder, may further complicate the course of developmental motor 
coordination disorder. Individuals with co-occurring disorders typically experience more 
impairment than individuals with a single diagnosis.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental motor coordination disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Developmental presentations
•	 The prevalence of developmental motor coordination disorder is approximately 5–6% of 
children aged 5–11 years, although up to 10% of children may have less severe difficulties 
with motor skills that still affect academic and social functioning.
•	 The manifestation of developmental motor coordination disorder symptoms varies with 
developmental stage.
Preschool 
In preschool-aged children, delays in meeting one or more motor milestones (e.g. sitting, 
crawling, walking) or in developing specific skills (e.g. climbing stairs, buttoning clothing, 
tying shoes) may be evident.
Middle childhood 
In middle childhood, symptoms may be evident in activities such as handwriting, playing 
with a ball, or building puzzles or models.
Adolescence and adulthood
By adolescence and adulthood, difficulties in motor coordination may manifest in 
attempts to master new skills, such as driving, using tools or note taking.
All developmental stages
Across all developmental stages, even once a skill is acquired, the execution of movements 
tends to be more awkward and less precise than in typically developing peers.
•	 Children with developmental motor coordination disorder may also be at increased risk of 
co-occurring disruptive behaviour problems, anxiety and depression. In addition, children 
with developmental motor coordination disorder tend to report lower levels of self-efficacy 
and competence in physical and social abilities, and are at heightened risk of becoming 
overweight or obese compared to their typically developing peers.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
• Developmental motor coordination disorder more frequently affects boys, with a ratio of 
boys to girls of between 2:1 and 7:1.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Individuals with disorders of intellectual development may exhibit delays in acquisition and 
impairment in the execution of coordinated motor skills, along with deficits in general intellectual 
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Developmental motor coordination disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

functioning and adaptive behaviour. If the diagnostic requirements of a disorder of intellectual 
development are met, and coordinated motor skills are significantly below what would be expected 
based on level of intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
In autism spectrum disorder, there may be reluctance to participate in tasks requiring complex 
motor coordination skills, such as ball sports, which is better accounted for by a lack of interest 
rather than any specific deficits in motor coordination.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Co-occurrence of developmental motor coordination disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder is common. Both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are 
met. However, some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may appear to be 
clumsy (e.g. bumping into obstacles, knocking things over) due to distractibility and impulsivity. 
Developmental motor coordination disorder should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system, diseases of the musculoskeletal 
system or connective tissue, and sensory impairment
Motor skills may be affected by diseases of the nervous system (e.g. cerebral palsy, muscular 
dystrophy), diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue, sensory impairment 
(especially severe visual impairment) or joint hypermobility, which are established by appropriate 
physical and laboratory examination. A diagnosis of developmental motor coordination disorder 
should not be assigned when the difficulties with motor coordination are solely attributable to one 
of these conditions. Some children with developmental motor coordination disorder show atypical 
motor activity (usually suppressed), such as choreiform movements of unsupported limbs or mirror 
movements.5 These “overflow” movements are not considered diseases of the nervous system per 
se, and do not exclude the diagnosis of developmental motor coordination disorder.
Boundary with effects of psychosocial deprivation
Extreme psychosocial deprivation in early childhood can produce impairments in motor functions. 
Depending on the onset, level of severity and duration of the deprivation, motor functioning 
may improve substantially after the child is moved to a more positive environment. However, 
some deficits may persist even after a sustained period in an environment that provides adequate 
stimulation for development, and a diagnosis of developmental motor coordination disorder may 
be appropriate in such cases if all diagnostic requirements are met.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A persistent pattern (e.g. over at least 6 months) of inattention symptoms and/or a 
combination of hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms that is outside the limits of normal 
variation expected for age and level of intellectual development is required for diagnosis. 
Symptoms vary according to chronological age and disorder severity.

Chorieform movements are involuntary, irregular and unpredictable movements that make it appear as if the affected person is 
dancing, twisting, restless, clumsy or fidgety.
6A05
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Inattention
Several symptoms of inattention that are persistent and sufficiently severe that they have 
a direct negative impact on academic, occupational or social functioning are among the 
essential components. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters:
• having difficulty sustaining attention on tasks that do not provide a high level of 
stimulation or reward or require sustained mental effort; lacking attention to detail; 
making careless mistakes in school or work assignments; not completing tasks;
• being easily distracted by extraneous stimuli or thoughts not related to the task at 
hand; often seeming not to listen when spoken to directly; frequently appearing to be 
daydreaming or to have their mind elsewhere;
• losing things; being forgetful in daily activities; having difficulty remembering to complete 
upcoming daily tasks or activities; having difficulty planning, managing and organizing 
schoolwork, tasks and other activities.
Note: inattention may not be evident when the individual is engaged in activities that 
provide intense stimulation and frequent rewards.
Hyperactivity-impulsivity
Several symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity that are persistent and sufficiently severe 
that they have a direct negative impact on academic, occupational or social functioning are 
among the essential components. These tend to be most evident in structured situations 
that require behavioural self-control. Symptoms are typically from the following clusters:
• showing excessive motor activity; leaving their seat when expected to sit still; often 
running about; having difficulty sitting still without fidgeting (younger children); 
displaying feelings of physical restlessness and a sense of discomfort with being quiet or 
sitting still (adolescents and adults);
• having difficulty engaging in activities quietly; talking too much;
• blurting out answers in school or comments at work; having difficulty waiting their turn 
in conversation, games or activities; interrupting or intruding on others’ conversations 
or games;
• having a tendency to act in response to immediate stimuli without deliberation or 
consideration of risks and consequences (e.g. engaging in behaviours with potential for 
physical injury; impulsive decisions; reckless driving).
• Evidence of significant inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms prior to age 12, 
though some individuals may first come to clinical attention later in adolescence or as adults, 
often when demands exceed the individual’s capacity to compensate for limitations.
• Manifestations of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity must be evident across multiple 
situations or settings (e.g. home, school, work, with friends or relatives), but are likely to vary 
according to the structure and demands of the setting.
• Symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety or fear-related 
disorder, a neurocognitive disorder such as delirium).
• Symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance (e.g. cocaine) or medication (e.g. bronchodilators, 
thyroid replacement medication) on the central nervous system, including and withdrawal effects, 
and are not due to a disease of the nervous system.

Specifiers to describe predominant characteristics of 
clinical presentation
• The characteristics of the current clinical presentation should be described using one of the 
following specifiers, which are meant to assist in recording the main reason for the current 
referral or services. Predominance of symptoms refers to the presence of several symptoms 
of either an inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive nature, with few or no symptoms of the 
other type.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly inattentive 
presentation
• All diagnostic requirements for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are met, and 
inattentive symptoms predominate.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive-
impulsive presentation
• All diagnostic requirements for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are met, and symptoms 
of hyperactivity-impulsivity predominate.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined presentation
• All diagnostic requirements for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are met, and both 
hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive symptoms are clinically significant aspects of the 
current clinical presentation, with neither clearly predominating.

Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder usually manifests in early or middle childhood. 
In many cases, hyperactivity symptoms predominate in preschool and decrease with age, 
such that they are no longer prominent beyond adolescence or may instead be reported as 
feelings of physical restlessness. Attentional problems may be more commonly observed 
beginning in later childhood, especially in school and among adults in occupational settings.
•	 The manifestations and severity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often vary 
according to the characteristics and demands of the environment. Symptoms and behaviours 
should be evaluated across multiple types of environments as a part of clinical assessment.
•	 Where available, teacher and parent reports should be obtained to establish the diagnosis 
in children and adolescents. In adults, the report of a significant other, family member or 
co-worker can provide important additional information.
•	 Some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may first present for services 
in adulthood. When making the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 
adults, a history of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity before 12 years of age is an 
important corroborating feature that can be best established from school or local records, 
or from informants who knew the individual during childhood. In the absence of such 
corroborating information, a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in older 
adolescents and adults should be made with caution.
•	 In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially in 
children, an exclusively inattentive presentation may occur. There is no hyperactivity, and 
the presentation is characterized by daydreaming, mind-wandering and a lack of focus. 
These children are sometimes referred to as exhibiting a “restrictive inattentive pattern of 
symptoms” or “sluggish cognitive tempo”.
•	 In a subset of individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined 
presentation, severe inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity are both consistently 
present in most of the situations that an individual encounters, and are also evidenced by 
the clinician’s own observations. This pattern is often referred to as “hyperkinetic disorder”, 
and is considered a more severe form of the disorder.
•	 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms often significantly limit academic 
achievement. Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often find it difficult to 
hold down a demanding job, and may be disproportionately underemployed or unemployed. 
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can also strain interpersonal relationships across 
the lifespan, including those with family members, peers and romantic partners. Individuals 
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have greater difficulty regulating their 
behaviour in the context of groups than in one-on-one situations.
•	 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often co-occurs with other neurodevelopmental 
disorders, including developmental speech and language disorders and primary tics and 
tic disorders, which are classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system but 
cross-listed under neurodevelopment disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is 
associated with an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder and gaming disorder, 
and with elevated rates of epilepsy. Emotional dysregulation, low frustration tolerance 
and subtle clumsiness and other minor (“soft”) neurological abnormalities in sensory and 
motor performance in the absence of any identifiable brain pathology are also common in 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of physical 
health problems including accidents.
•	 Acute onset of hyperactive behaviour in a school-aged child or adolescent should raise 
the possibility that symptoms are better accounted for by another mental disorder or by a 
medical condition. For example, abrupt onset of hyperactivity in adolescence or adulthood 
may indicate an emergent primary psychotic or bipolar disorder.
•	 Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorder tends to run in families, with evidence 
of high heritability, the predominant symptom pattern in attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder in a given individual often changes over time and cannot be predicted based on 
the predominant symptoms of other family members.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms are present in many children, 
adolescents and adults, especially during certain developmental periods (e.g. early 
childhood). The diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder requires that these 
symptoms be persistent across time, pervasive across situations and significantly out 
of keeping with developmental level, and have a direct negative impact on academic, 
occupational or social functioning.
Course features
•	 Nearly half of all children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will 
continue to exhibit symptoms into adolescence. Predictors of persistence into adolescence 
and adulthood include co-occurring childhood-onset mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders, lower intellectual functioning, poorer social functioning 
and behavioural problems.
•	 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend to remain stable throughout 
adolescence, with approximately one third of individuals diagnosed in childhood 
continuing to experience impairment in adulthood.
•	 Although symptoms of hyperactivity become less overt during adolescence and adulthood, 
individuals may still experience difficulties with inattention, impulsivity and restlessness.
Developmental presentations
•	 Adolescents and adults may only seek clinical services after 12 years of age, once symptoms 
become more limiting with increasing social, emotional and academic demands or in the 
context of an evolving co-occurring mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder 
that results in an exacerbation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Culture-related features
•	 The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder consistently fall into two separate 
dimensions across cultures: inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity. However, culture 
can influence both acceptability of symptoms and how caregivers respond to them.
•	 The assessment of hyperactivity should take into account cultural norms of age and gender-
appropriate behaviour. For example, in some countries hyperactive behaviour may be seen 
as a sign of strength in a boy (e.g. “boiling blood”) while being perceived very negatively 
in a girl.
•	 Symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity may occur in response to exposure 
to traumatic events and grief reactions during childhood, particularly in highly vulnerable 
and disadvantaged populations, including in post-conflict areas. In these settings, 
clinicians should consider whether the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
is warranted.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent among males.
•	 Females are more likely to exhibit inattentive symptoms whereas males are more likely to 
exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, particularly at younger ages.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Co-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disorders of intellectual development 
is common, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted. However, symptoms of inattention 
and hyperactivity (e.g. restlessness) are common in children without attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder who are placed in academic settings that are out of keeping with their intellectual abilities. 
A diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in individuals with disorders of intellectual 
development requires that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms are disproportionate 
to the individual’s level of intellectual functioning.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Specific abnormalities in attention (e.g. being overly focused or easily distracted), impulsivity and 
physical hyperactivity are often observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and may 
sometimes dominate the clinical presentation. Unlike individuals with autism spectrum disorder, 
those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit the persistent deficits in initiating 
and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions, or the persistent restricted, 
repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are the defining features of 
autism spectrum disorder. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with developmental learning disorder
Individuals with developmental learning disorder without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
may exhibit symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity when asked to focus on specific academic 
activities that correspond to their areas of difficulty (i.e. reading, mathematics or writing). If difficulty 
in sustaining attention on academic tasks or appropriately modulating activity level occurs only 
in response to these tasks, and there is evidence of limitations in acquisition of academic skills in 
the specific corresponding area, a diagnosis of developmental learning disorder and not attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder should be assigned.
Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorder
Co-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and developmental motor coordination 
disorder is common, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted. However, apparent 
clumsiness in some individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (e.g. bumping into 
obstacles, knocking things over) that is due to distractibility and impulsivity should not be diagnosed 
as developmental motor coordination disorder.
Boundary with mood disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur with mood disorders and anxiety and fear-
related disorders, but inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity can also be features of these disorders 
in individuals without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. For example, symptoms such as 
restlessness, pacing and impaired concentration can be features of a depressive episode, and should 
not be considered as part of the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder unless they have 
been present since childhood and persist after the resolution of the depressive episode. Inattention, 
impulsivity and hyperactivity are typical features of manic and hypomanic episodes. At the same 
time, mood lability and irritability may be associated features of attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder. Late adolescent or adult onset, episodicity and intensity of mood elevation characteristic 
of bipolar disorders are features that assist in differentiation from attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder. Fidgeting, restlessness and tension in the context of anxiety and fear-related disorders may 
resemble hyperactivity. Furthermore, anxious preoccupations or reaction to anxiety-provoking 
stimuli in individuals with anxiety and fear-related disorders can be associated with difficulties 
concentrating. To qualify for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis in the presence 
of a mood disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder, inattention and/or hyperactivity should 
not be exclusively associated with mood episodes, be solely attributable to anxious preoccupations, 
or occur specifically in response to anxiety-provoking situations.
Boundary with intermittent explosive disorder
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and intermittent explosive disorder are both characterized 
by impulsive behaviour. However, intermittent explosive disorder is specifically characterized by 
intermittent severe impulsive outbursts or aggression rather than ongoing generalized behavioural 
impulsivity that may be seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have difficulty following instructions, 
complying with rules and getting along with others, but these difficulties are primarily accounted 
for by symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity (e.g. failure to follow long and 
complicated instructions, difficulty remaining seated or staying on task). In contrast, noncompliance 
in individuals with oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by deliberate defiance or 
disobedience and not by problems with inattention or with controlling behavioural impulses or 
inhibiting inappropriate behaviours. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common.
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder
In adolescents and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, some behaviours that are 
manifestations of impulsivity such as grabbing objects, reckless driving or impulsive decision-making 
– such as suddenly walking out of jobs or relationships – may bring the individual in conflict with 
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
other people and the law. In contrast, individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder typically lack 
the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, and exhibit a repetitive and persistent pattern of 
behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules or laws 
are violated. However, co-occurrence of these disorders is common.
Boundary with personality disorder
Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often experience problems with psychosocial 
functioning and interpersonal relationships, including regulation of emotions and negative 
emotionality. If attention deficit hyperactivity disorder persists into adolescence and adulthood, 
it may be difficult to distinguish from personality disorder with prominent personality features of 
disinhibition, which includes irresponsibility, impulsivity, distractibility and recklessness, and from 
negative affectivity, which refers to a habitual tendency to manifest a broad range of distressing 
emotions including anxiety, anger, self-loathing, irritability and increased sensitivity to negative 
stimuli. The utility of assigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in situations where 
there is an established diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder depends on the specific 
clinical situation.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use and the effects of certain prescribed 
medications
Abuse of alcohol, nicotine, cannabis and stimulants is common among individuals with attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly adolescents and adults. However, the effects of these 
substances can also mimic the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in individuals 
without the diagnosis. Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity are also associated 
with the effects of certain prescribed medications (e.g. anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and 
valproate, antipsychotics such as risperidone, and somatic treatments such as bronchodilators and 
thyroid replacement medication). The temporal order of onset and the persistence of inattention, 
hyperactivity and impulsivity in the absence of intoxication or continued medication use are 
important in differentiating between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disorders due 
to substance use or the effects of prescribed medications. A review of current medications and 
informants who knew the individual before they started using the substances or medications in 
question are critical in making this distinction.
Boundary with attentional symptoms due to other medical conditions
A variety of other medical conditions may influence attentional processes (e.g. hypoglycaemia, 
hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, exposure to toxins, sleep-wake disorders), resulting in 
temporary or persistent symptoms that resemble or interact with those of attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder. As a basis for appropriate management, it is important to evaluate in such 
cases whether the symptoms are secondary to the medical condition or are more indicative of 
comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Stereotyped movement disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, 
apparently purposeless and often rhythmic movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, 
head banging, eye poking and hand biting) that are not caused by the direct physiological 
effects of a substance or medication (including withdrawal) is required for diagnosis.
6A06
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Stereotyped movement disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Stereotyped movements result in significant interference with the ability to engage in 
normal daily activities, or result in self-inflicted bodily injury severe enough to be an 
independent focus of clinical attention or that would result in self-injury if protective 
measures were not taken.
•	 Onset occurs during the developmental period, typically at an early age.
Specifiers related to self-injury
A specifier should be applied with the diagnosis of stereotyped movement disorder to indicate 
whether it involves movements that result in physical harm to the individual.
Stereotyped movement disorder without self-injury
•	 Stereotyped movements do not result in physical harm to the affected individual even 
without the presence of protective measures. These behaviours typically include body 
rocking, head rocking, finger-flicking mannerisms and hand flapping.
Stereotyped movement disorder with self-injury
•	 Stereotyped movements result in harm to the affected individual that is severe enough to 
be an independent focus of clinical attention, or would result in self-injury if protective 
measures (e.g. helmet to prevent head injury) were not taken. These behaviours typically 
include head banging, face slapping, eye poking and biting of the hands, lips or other 
body parts.
Stereotyped movement disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Co-occurrence of stereotyped movement disorder and disorders of intellectual development 
is common.

Neurodevelopmental disorders | Stereotyped movement disorder

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Many young children show stereotyped behaviours (e.g. thumb sucking). In older children 
and adults, repetitive behaviours such as leg shaking, finger drumming/tapping or self-
stimulatory behaviours (e.g. masturbation) may be seen in response to boredom. These 
behaviours are differentiated from stereotyped movement disorder because they do not 
result in significant interference with normal daily activities; nor do they result in self-
inflicted bodily injury that is severe enough to be an independent focus of clinical attention.
Course features
•	 Among typically developing children, stereotyped movements remit over time (or become 
suppressed). Among individuals with a disorder of intellectual development and autism 
spectrum disorder with disorder of intellectual development, however, stereotyped (and 
self-injurious) behaviours may persist, though the presentation of these behaviours may 
change over time.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of stereotyped movement disorder occurs early in the developmental period, with 
stereotyped movements often emerging before 3 years of age; up to 80% of children who 
exhibit complex motor stereotyped movements display them before 2 years of age.
•	 Stereotyped movements are common in typically developing children, and often resolve 
with time – particularly simple stereotyped movements (such as rocking). The development 
of complex stereotyped movements is estimated to occur in 3–4% of children.
•	 Stereotyped movement disorder commonly co-occurs with disorders of intellectual 
development and autism spectrum disorder.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
• Preschool-aged boys with autism spectrum disorder and with a disorder of intellectual 
development tend to have higher rates of co-occurring stereotyped movement disorder.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Stereotyped movement disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. rocking), gait 
atypicalities (e.g. walking on tiptoes) and unusual hand or finger movements can be a characteristic 
feature of autism spectrum disorder, but are differentiated from stereotyped movement disorder by 
the presence of additional significant limitations in the capacity for reciprocal social interactions and 
social communication. Assignment of both diagnoses may be warranted if the stereotyped motor 
movements constitute a separate focus of clinical attention (e.g. due to self-injury).
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
In contrast to stereotyped movement disorder, repetitive behaviours (i.e. compulsions) observed in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder are typically more complex, and are aimed at neutralizing unwanted 
intrusive thoughts (i.e. obsessions) and reducing associated negative emotions (e.g. anxiety).
Boundary with body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders
Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders (e.g. trichotillomania and excoriation disorder) are 
characterized by recurrent and habitual behaviours directed at the integument (e.g. hair and skin). 
In contrast, stereotyped movements in stereotyped movement disorder rarely include hair-pulling or 
skin-picking behaviour; if they do, the behaviour tends to be composed of coordinated movements 
that are patterned and predictable, utilizing the same muscle groups in a particular sequence to 
produce the behaviour. In addition, stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early 
in life (below 2 years of age), whereas body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders typically have 
an onset in later childhood or early adolescence.
Boundary with Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders
In contrast to tic disorders including Tourette syndrome, stereotyped movements in stereotyped 
movement disorder tend to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and 
predictable, and can be interrupted with distraction. Stereotyped movement disorder is further 
differentiated from tics and Tourette syndrome because the symptoms tend to emerge at a younger 
age, last longer than typical tics, lack a premonitory sensory urge, and may be experienced as 
enjoyable.
Boundary with drug-induced dystonia (tardive dyskinesia).
Drug-induced dystonia is a movement disorder (classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous 
system) that is most frequently caused by antipsychotic medication. It is also sometimes referred 
to as tardive dyskinesia. Symptoms may include involuntary oral or facial movements or, less 
commonly, irregular trunk or limb movements. A diagnosis of stereotyped movement disorder is 
not appropriate in such cases.
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system
Involuntary movements associated with diseases of the nervous system usually follow a typical 
pattern with the presence of pathognomic signs and symptoms. If stereotyped movements are 
associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or another specific disease of the nervous system or 
neurodevelopmental disease, stereotyped movement disorder should not be diagnosed unless 
the movements become a separate focus of clinical attention. In such cases, both diagnoses may 
be assigned.

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Other specified neurodevelopmental disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of 
specific intellectual, motor, language or social functions that arise during the developmental 
period and share primary clinical features with other neurodevelopmental disorders.
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
neurodevelopmental disorders grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. a psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, a disorder 
specifically associated with stress).
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally typical and are not entirely 
attributable to external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage or lack of 
access to educational opportunities.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition that 
is not classified under mental and behavioural disorders, and are not due to the effects 
of a substance (e.g. alcohol) or medication (e.g. bronchodilators) on the central nervous 
system, including withdrawal effects.
•	 The difficulties result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning.

Tourette syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of both motor tics and phonic tics that may or may not manifest concurrently 
or continuously during the symptomatic course is required for diagnosis.
•	 Motor and phonic tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic and recurrent 
movements or vocalizations, respectively.
•	 Motor and phonic tics have been present for at least 1 year with onset during the 
developmental period.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. Huntington 
disease), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (e.g. amfetamine), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from benzodiazepines).
Additional clinical features
• Tourette syndrome frequently co-occurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and 
impulsivity, disinhibition, anxiety and immature behaviour may be associated features of 
both diagnoses.
• Motor and phonic tics in Tourette syndrome may be voluntarily suppressed for short periods 
of time, may be exacerbated by stress, and may diminish during sleep or during periods of 
focused enjoyable activity.
• Tics are often highly suggestible – for example, when an individual with Tourette syndrome 
is asked about specific symptoms, old tics that have been absent for some time may 
transiently reappear.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Transient motor or phonic tics (e.g. eye blinking, throat clearing) are common during 
childhood, and are differentiated from Tourette syndrome by their transient nature.
8A05.00
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Secondary-parented categories in neurodevelopmental disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Course features
•	 The onset of Tourette syndrome commonly occurs during childhood (between the ages of 
4 and 6 years), with peak symptom severity occurring between the ages of 8 and 12 years. 
Across adolescence, there is decreasing likelihood of onset. Onset during adulthood is 
rare and most often associated with severe psychosocial stressors, use of specific drugs 
(e.g. cocaine) or an insult to the central nervous system (e.g. post-viral encephalitis).
•	 The onset of Tourette syndrome is typically characterized by transient bouts of simple 
motor tics such as eye blinking or head jerks. Phonic tics usually begin 1–2 years after 
the onset of motor symptoms and initially tend to be simple in character (e.g. throat 
clearing, grunting, or squeaking), but then may gradually develop into more complex 
vocal symptoms that include repetition of one’s own or another person’s speech or obscene 
utterances (i.e. coprolalia). Sometimes the latter is associated with gestural echopraxia, 
which also may be of an obscene nature (i.e. copropraxia).
•	 Vocal and/or motor tics may wax and wane in severity, with some individuals experiencing 
remission of symptoms for weeks or months at a time. Eventually the symptoms become 
more persistent, and can be accompanied by detrimental effects to personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
•	 The majority of individuals with Tourette syndrome will experience significantly 
diminished symptoms by early adulthood, with more than one third experiencing a full 
remission of symptoms.
•	 Evidence suggests a good long-term clinical course for individuals with a solitary diagnosis 
of Tourette syndrome. Those with co-occurring conditions (e.g. obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, 
depressive disorders) tend to exhibit a poorer prognosis.
Developmental presentations
•	 The prevalence rate of Tourette syndrome among school-aged children has been estimated 
at approximately 0.5%.
•	 Motor and phonic tics in Tourette syndrome tend to be most severe between the ages 
of 8 and 12 years, gradually diminishing throughout adolescence. By late childhood 
(approximately 10 years of age), most children become aware of premonitory urges (bodily 
sensations) and increased discomfort preceding – and relief of tension following – motor 
and vocal tics.
•	 The vocal symptom of coprolalia (inappropriate swearing, experienced involuntarily) is 
uncommon, affecting only 10–15% of individuals with Tourette syndrome, and tends to 
emerge in mid-adolescence.
•	 Many adults with childhood-onset Tourette syndrome report attenuated symptoms, 
though a small number of adults will continue to experience severe tic symptoms.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Secondary-parented categories in neurodevelopmental disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The pattern of co-occurring disorders appears to vary with developmental stage. Children 
with Tourette syndrome are more likely to experience attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and separation 
anxiety disorder compared to adolescents and adults. Adolescents and adults are more 
likely than children to develop a depressive disorder, a disorder due to substance use or a 
bipolar disorder.
Culture-related features
•	 Symptoms of Tourette syndrome are consistent across cultural groups.
•	 If vocalizations or movements have a specific function or meaning in the context of an 
individual’s culture and are used in ways that are consistent with that cultural function or 
meaning, they should not be considered evidence of Tourette syndrome.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Tourette syndrome is more common among males than females (gender ratio ranging 
from 2:1 to 4:1).
•	 Course and symptom presentation do not vary by gender.
•	 Women with persistent tic disorders may be more likely to experience co-occurring anxiety 
and fear-related disorders and depressive disorders.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder and stereotyped movement disorder
Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. rocking) and 
unusual hand or finger movements can be a characteristic feature of autism spectrum disorder and 
of stereotyped movement disorder. These behaviours can appear similar to tics, but are differentiated 
because they tend to be more stereotyped, last longer than the duration of a typical tic, tend to emerge 
at a younger age, are not characterized by premonitory sensory urges, are often experienced by the 
individual as soothing or rewarding, and can generally be interrupted with distraction.
Neurodevelopmental disorders | Secondary-parented categories in neurodevelopmental disorders

Neurodevelopmental disorders
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Repetitive, recurrent movements or vocalizations can also be symptomatic of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder. Tics can be differentiated from obsessive-compulsive disorder because they appear 
unintentional in nature and clearly utilize a discrete muscle group. However, it can be difficult to 
distinguish between complex tics and compulsions associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
Although tics (both complex and simple) are preceded by premonitory sensory urges, which may 
diminish over time, tics are not aimed at neutralizing antecedent cognitions (e.g. obsessions) or 
reducing physiological arousal (e.g. anxiety). Many individuals exhibit symptoms of both obsessive-
compulsive disorder and Tourette syndrome, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic 
requirements for each are met.
Boundary with self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviours
With enough force and repetition, motor tics may lead to self-injury. However, unlike self-injurious 
and self-mutilating behaviour, Tourette syndrome is not associated with an intention to cause 
self-injury.
Chronic motor tic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The persistent presence of motor tics is required for diagnosis.
•	 Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic and recurrent movements.
•	 Motor tics have been present for at least 1 year, with onset during the developmental period.
Note: other CDDR elements for chronic motor tic disorder are provided below, following the 
essential features for chronic phonic tic disorder.
Chronic phonic tic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The persistent presence of phonic tics is required for diagnosis.
•	 Phonic tics are defined as sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic and recurrent vocalizations.
•	 Phonic tics have been present for at least 1 year, with onset during the developmental period.

•	 Tics are often highly suggestible – for example, when an individual with chronic motor tic 
disorder or chronic phonic tic disorder is asked about specific symptoms, old tics that have

Boundary with normality (threshold) for chronic motor tic disorder 
and chronic phonic tic disorder
• Transient motor or phonic tics (e.g. eye blinking, throat clearing) are common during 
childhood, and are differentiated from chronic motor tic disorder and chronic phonic tic 
disorder by their transient nature.
Developmental presentations for chronic motor tic disorder and 
chronic phonic tic disorder
• The prevalence of chronic motor tic disorder is estimated at between 0.3% and 0.8% of 
school-aged children.
• Less is known about the prevalence of chronic phonic tic disorder.
Culture-related features for chronic motor tic disorder and chronic 
phonic tic disorder
• If vocalizations or movements have a specific function or meaning in the context of an 
individual’s culture and are used in ways that are consistent with that cultural function or 
meaning, they should not be considered evidence of chronic motor tic disorder or chronic 
phonic tic disorder.

Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements such as whole-body movements (e.g. rocking) and 
unusual hand or finger movements can be a characteristic feature of autism spectrum disorder and 
of stereotyped movement disorder. These behaviours can appear similar to tics but are differentiated 
because they tend to be more stereotyped, last longer than the duration of a typical tic, tend to emerge

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders include 
the following:
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders is a grouping of disorders characterized by 
significant impairments in reality testing, and alterations in behaviour as manifested in symptoms 
such as delusions, hallucinations, formal thought disorder (typically manifested as disorganized 
speech) and disorganized behaviour. They may be accompanied by psychomotor disturbances 
and negative symptoms such as blunted or flat affect. These symptoms do not occur primarily 
as a result of substance use (e.g. hallucinogen intoxication) or another medical condition not 
classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. Huntington 
disease). The disorders in this grouping are referred to as “primary psychotic disorders” because 
psychotic symptoms are their defining feature. Psychotic symptoms may also occur in the context 
of other mental disorders (e.g. in mood disorders or dementia), but in these cases the symptoms 
occur alongside other characteristic features of those disorders. Whereas experiences of reality 
loss/distortion occur on a continuum and can be found throughout the population, disorders in 
this group represent patterns of symptoms and behaviours that occur with sufficient frequency 
and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural expectations.

not be used to classify the expression of ideas, beliefs or behaviours that are culturally sanctioned. 
Many religious or cultural practices worldwide incorporate experiences qualitatively similar 
in nature to the symptoms described for this grouping of disorders, and these should not be 
considered to be pathological.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

General cultural considerations for schizophrenia and other primary 
psychotic disorders
•	 Beliefs vary across cultures such that those considered odd or unusual in one culture may 
be normative in another. For example, belief in witchcraft or supernatural forces, or fears 
that transgressing cultural norms can lead to misfortune, are typical in many cultures. 
Distress may be expressed in ways that may be misinterpreted as evidence of psychotic 
symptoms, such as pseudo-hallucinations and overvalued ideas or dissociative experiences 
related to trauma.
•	 In some cultures, distress due to social circumstances may be expressed in ways that can be 
misinterpreted as psychotic symptoms (e.g. overvalued ideas and pseudo-hallucinations) 
but that instead are considered normal for the person’s subgroup.
•	 Symptom presentation of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may 
vary across cultures. For example, the content and form of hallucinations (e.g. visual 
hallucinations are more common in some cultural groups and in some countries) or 
delusions may be culturally derived, making it difficult to differentiate among culturally 
normal experiences, overvalued ideas, ideas of reference and transient psychosis. For 
instance, in several cultures (e.g. southern China, Latin America) it is common to expect 
the spirit of a deceased relative to visit the homes of living relatives soon after they die. 
Hearing, seeing or interacting with this spirit may be reported without notable pathological 
sequelae. Clarifying the cultural meaning of these experiences can aid in understanding 
the diagnostic significance of the symptom presentation.
•	 Cultural mismatch between the individual and the clinician may complicate the evaluation 
of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders. Collateral information from 
family, community, religious or cultural reference groups may help clarify the diagnosis.
•	 Ethnic minority and migrant groups are more likely than those in the general population 
to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorder. This may be 
due to misdiagnosis or to greater risk of psychosis resulting from migration traumas, social 
isolation, minority and acculturative stress, discrimination and victimization.
•	 Caution is advised when assessing psychotic symptoms through interpreters or in a second 
or third language because of the risk of misconstruing unfamiliar metaphors as delusions, 
and natural defensiveness as paranoia or emotional blunting.
Schizophrenia
Essential (required) features
•	 At least two of the following symptoms must be present (by the individual’s report or 
through observation by the clinician or other informants) most of the time for a period 
of 1 month or more. At least one of the qualifying symptoms should be from items 
a) to d) below:
a)	 persistent delusions (e.g. grandiose delusions, delusions of reference, persecutory 
delusions);
b)	 persistent hallucinations (most commonly auditory, although they may be in any 
sensory modality);
6A20
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
c)	 disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder) (e.g. tangentiality and loose 
associations, irrelevant speech, neologisms) – when severe, the person’s speech may 
be so incoherent as to be incomprehensible (“word salad”);
d)	 experiences of influence, passivity or control (i.e. the experience that one’s feelings, 
impulses, actions or thoughts are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s 
mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being 
broadcast to others);
e)	 negative symptoms such as affective flattening, alogia or paucity of speech, avolition, 
asociality and anhedonia;
f)	 grossly disorganized behaviour that impedes goal-directed activity (e.g. behaviour 
that appears bizarre or purposeless, unpredictable or inappropriate emotional 
responses that interferes with the ability to organize behaviour);
g)	 psychomotor disturbances such as catatonic restlessness or agitation, posturing, 
waxy flexibility, negativism, mutism or stupor. Note: if the full syndrome of catatonia 
(p. 202) is present in the context of schizophrenia, the diagnosis of 6A40 Catatonia 
associated with another mental disorder should also be assigned.
• The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g. corticosteroids) on the central 
nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol).
Course specifiers for schizophrenia
The following specifiers should be applied to identify the course of schizophrenia, including 
whether the individual currently meets the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia or is in 
partial or full remission. Course specifiers are also used to indicate whether the current episode 
is the first episode of schizophrenia, whether there have been multiple such episodes, or whether 
symptoms have been continuous over an extended period of time.
Schizophrenia, first episode
• The first episode specifier should be applied when the current or most recent episode is the first 
manifestation of schizophrenia meeting all diagnostic requirements in terms of symptoms 
and duration. If there has been a previous episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 
the multiple episodes specifier should be applied.
Schizophrenia, first episode, currently symptomatic
•	 All diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia in terms of symptoms and duration are 
currently met, or have been met within the past month.
• There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Note: if the duration of the episode is more than 1 year, the continuous specifier may be used 
instead, depending on the clinical situation.

Schizophrenia, first episode, in partial remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia have not been met within the past 
month, but some clinically significant symptoms remain, which may or may not be 
associated with functional impairment.
•	 There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Note: this category may also be used to designate the re-emergence of subthreshold symptoms 
of schizophrenia following an asymptomatic period in a person who has previously met the 
diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia, first episode, in full remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia have not been met within the past 
month, and no clinically significant symptoms remain.
•	 There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Schizophrenia, first episode, unspecified
Schizophrenia, multiple episodes
•	 The multiple episodes specifier should be applied when there have been a minimum of two 
episodes meeting all diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder 
in terms of symptoms, with a period of partial or full remission between episodes lasting 
at least 3 months, and the current or most recent episode is schizophrenia. Note that the 
1-month duration requirement for the first episode does not necessarily need to be met 
for subsequent episodes. During the period of remission, the diagnostic requirements of 
schizophrenia are either only partially fulfilled or absent.
Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, currently symptomatic
•	 All symptom requirements for schizophrenia are currently met, or have been met within 
the past month. Note that the 1-month duration requirement for the first episode does not 
necessarily need to be met for subsequent episodes.
•	 There have been a minimum of two episodes of schizophrenia or a previous episode of 
schizoaffective disorder, with a period of partial or full remission between episodes lasting 
at least 3 months.
Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, in partial remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia have not been met within the past

during the person’s lifetime since its first onset, with periods of subthreshold symptoms 
being very brief relative to the overall course. In order to apply this specifier to a first 
episode, the duration of schizophrenia should be at least 1 year. In that case, the continuous 
specifier should be applied instead of the first episode specifier.
Schizophrenia, continuous, currently symptomatic
•	 All symptom requirements for schizophrenia are currently met, or have been met within 
the past month.
•	 Symptoms meeting the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia have been present for 
almost all of the course of the disorder during the person’s lifetime since its first onset.
•	 Periods of partial or full remission have been very brief relative to the overall course, and 
none have lasted for 3 months or longer.
•	 To apply the continuous specifier to a first episode, symptoms meeting the diagnostic 
requirements for schizophrenia must have been present for at least 1 year.
Schizophrenia, continuous, in partial remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia, continuous were previously met but 
have not been met within the past month.
•	 Some clinically significant symptoms of schizophrenia remain, which may or may not be 
associated with functional impairment.

Additional clinical features
•	 The onset of schizophrenia may be acute, with serious disturbance apparent within a few 
days, or insidious, with a gradual development of signs and symptoms.
•	 A prodromal phase often precedes the onset of psychotic symptoms by weeks or months. 
The characteristic features of this phase often include loss of interest in work or social 
activities, neglect of personal appearance or hygiene, inversion of the sleep cycle and 
attenuated psychotic symptoms, accompanied by negative symptoms, anxiety/agitation or 
varying degrees of depressive symptoms.
•	 Between acute episodes there may be residual phases, which are similar phenomenologically 
to the prodromal phase.
•	 Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and significant impairment 
in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning. However, distress and psychosocial impairment are not requirements for a 
diagnosis of schizophrenia.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Psychotic-like symptoms or unusual subjective experiences may occur in the general 
population, but these are usually fleeting in nature and are not accompanied by other

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
symptoms of schizophrenia or a deterioration in psychosocial functioning. In schizophrenia, 
multiple persistent symptoms are present, and are typically accompanied by impairment in 
cognitive functioning and other psychosocial problems.
Course features
•	 The course and onset of schizophrenia is variable. Some experience exacerbations and 
remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others experience a gradual 
worsening of symptoms, and a smaller proportion experience complete remission of 
symptoms.
•	 Positive symptoms tend to diminish naturally over time, whereas negative symptoms often 
persist and are closely tied to a poorer prognosis. Cognitive symptoms also tend to be more 
persistent, and when present are associated with ongoing functional impairment.
•	 Early-onset schizophrenia is typically associated with a poorer prognosis whereas affective 
and social functioning are more likely to be preserved with later onset.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of fully symptomatic schizophrenia before puberty is extremely rare; when it occurs 
it is often preceded by a decline in social and academic functioning, odd behaviour, 
and a change in affect observable during the prodromal phase. Childhood onset is also 
associated with a greater prevalence of delays in social, language or motor development 
and co-occurring disorder of intellectual development or developmental learning disorder.
•	 In children and young adolescents, auditory hallucinations most commonly occur 
as a single voice commenting on or commanding behaviour whereas in adults such 
hallucinations are more typically experienced as multiple conversing voices.
•	 In children and adolescents, it may be challenging to differentiate delusions and 
hallucinations from more developmentally typical phenomena (e.g. a “monster” under 
the child’s bed, an imaginary friend), actual plausible life experiences (e.g. being teased 
or bullied at school), and irrational or magical thinking common in childhood (e.g. that 
thinking about something will make it happen).
•	 Among children with schizophrenia, negative symptoms, hallucinations and disorganized 
thinking – including loose associations, illogical thinking and paucity of speech – tend to 
be prominent features of the clinical presentation. Disorganized thinking and behaviour 
occur in a variety of disorders that are common in childhood (e.g. autism spectrum 
disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), which should be considered before 
attributing the symptoms to the much less common childhood schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Cultural factors may influence the onset, symptom pattern, course and outcome 
of schizophrenia. For example, among migrants and ethnic and cultural minority 
communities, living in areas with a low proportion of their own migrant, ethnic or cultural 
group (low “ethnic density”) is associated with higher rates of schizophrenia. In addition, 
etiological or course-related factors may be affected by culture at the level of the family 
(e.g. level of family support or style of family interaction, such as expressed emotion) or at 
the societal context (e.g. industrialization, urbanization). For example, the prevalence of 
schizophrenia is much higher in urban than rural settings.
•	 The risk of misdiagnosing the expression of distress as indicative of schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder may be increased among ethnic minority and 
immigrant groups, and in other situations in which the clinician is unfamiliar with 
culturally normative expressions of distress. These include situations involving spiritual 
or supernatural beliefs or resulting from migration trauma, social isolation, minority and 
acculturative stress, discrimination and victimization.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Schizophrenia is more prevalent among males.
•	 The age of onset of the first psychotic episode differs by gender, with a greater proportion 
of males experiencing onset in their early to mid-20s and females in their late 20s.
•	 Females with schizophrenia tend to report more positive symptoms that increase in severity 
over the course of their lives. Females also tend to have greater mood disturbance and a 
greater prevalence of subsequent or co-occurring mental disorders (e.g. schizoaffective 
disorder, depressive disorders).
•	 Females with schizophrenia are less likely to exhibit disorganized thinking, negative 
symptoms and social impairment.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizoaffective disorder
The diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are intended to apply to the current 
or most recent episode of the disorder. In other words, a previous diagnosis of schizoaffective 
disorder does not preclude a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and vice versa. In both schizophrenia and 
schizoaffective disorder, at least two the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia are present most of 
the time for a period of 1 month or more. In schizoaffective disorder, the symptoms of schizophrenia 
are present concurrently with mood symptoms that meet the full diagnostic requirements of a 
mood episode and last for at least 1 month, and the onsets of the psychotic and mood symptoms 
are either simultaneous or occur within a few days of one another. In schizophrenia, co-occurring 
mood symptoms, if any, either do not persist for as long as 1 month or are not of sufficient severity 
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
to meet the requirements of a moderate or severe depressive episode, a manic episode or a mixed 
episode. (See mood episode descriptions, p. 212.) An episode that initially meets the diagnostic 
requirements for schizoaffective disorder in which only the mood symptoms remit, so that the 
duration of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms is much longer than the duration of 
concurrent symptoms, may be best characterized as an episode of schizophrenia.
Boundary with acute and transient psychotic disorder
The psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia persist for at least 1 month in their full, florid form. 
In contrast, the symptoms in acute and transient psychotic disorder tend to fluctuate rapidly in 
intensity and type across time, such that the content and focus of delusions or hallucinations often 
shift, even on a daily basis. Such rapid shifts would be unusual in schizophrenia. Negative symptoms 
are often present in schizophrenia, but do not occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder. The 
duration of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, and most often lasts 
from a few days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for schizophrenia. In cases 
that meet the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia except that they have lasted less than the 
duration required for a diagnosis (i.e. 1 month) in the absence of a previous history of schizophrenia, 
a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder and not acute and transient psychotic 
disorder should be assigned.
Boundary with schizotypal disorder
Schizotypal disorder is characterized by an enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions, 
beliefs and behaviours that resemble attenuated forms of the defining symptoms of schizophrenia. 
Schizophrenia is differentiated from schizotypal disorder based entirely on the intensity of 
the symptoms: schizophrenia is diagnosed if the symptoms are sufficiently intense to meet 
diagnostic requirements.
Boundary with delusional disorder
Both schizophrenia and delusional disorder may be characterized by persistent delusions. If 
other features are present that meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia (i.e. persistent 
hallucinations; disorganized thinking; experiences of influence, passivity or control; negative 
symptoms; disorganized or abnormal psychomotor behaviour), a diagnosis of schizophrenia 
should be made instead of a diagnosis of delusional disorder. However, hallucinations that are 
consistent with the content of the delusions and do not occur persistently (i.e. with regular 
frequency for 1 month or longer) are consistent with a diagnosis of delusional disorder rather than 
schizophrenia. Delusional disorder is generally characterized by relatively preserved personality 
and less deterioration and impairment in social and occupational functioning than schizophrenia, 
and individuals with delusional disorder tend to come to clinical attention for the first time at a later 
age. Individuals with symptom presentations consistent with delusional disorder (e.g. delusions and 
related, circumscribed hallucinations) but who have not met the minimum duration requirement 
of 3 months should not be assigned a diagnosis of schizophrenia, even though the combination 
of persistent delusions and related hallucinations technically meets diagnostic requirements for 
schizophrenia. Instead, a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder is more appropriate 
in such cases.
Boundary with moderate or severe depressive episodes in single episode 
depressive disorder, recurrent depressive disorder, and bipolar type I and bipolar 
type II disorders
Psychotic symptoms may also occur during moderate or severe depressive episodes. Delusions 
during depressive episodes may resemble delusions observed in schizophrenia, and are commonly 
persecutory or self-referential (e.g. being pursued by authorities because of imaginary crimes). 
Delusions of guilt (e.g. falsely blaming oneself for wrongdoing), poverty (e.g. being bankrupt) 
or impending disaster (perceived to have been brought on by the individual), as well as somatic 
delusions (e.g. of having contracted some serious disease) and nihilistic delusions (e.g. believing 
body organs do not exist), are also known to occur. Experiences of passivity, influence or control 
(e.g. thought insertion, thought withdrawal or thought broadcasting) may also occur in moderate or 
severe depressive episodes. Hallucinations are usually transient, and rarely occur in the absence of 
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizophrenia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

delusions. Auditory hallucinations (e.g. derogatory or accusatory voices that berate the individual for 
imaginary weaknesses or sins) are more common than visual (e.g. visions of death or destruction) or 
olfactory (e.g. the smell of rotting flesh) hallucinations. However, in a moderate or severe depressive 
episode with psychotic symptoms, the psychotic symptoms are confined to the mood episode. 
Schizophrenia is differentiated from depressive episodes in mood disorders by the occurrence of 
psychotic and other symptoms that meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia during 
periods without mood symptoms that meet the diagnostic requirements of a moderate or severe 
depressive episode. If the diagnostic requirements for both schizophrenia and a moderate or severe 
depressive episode are met concurrently, and both the psychotic and mood symptoms last for at 
least 1 month, schizoaffective disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.
Boundary with manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I disorder
Psychotic symptoms may occur during manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I disorder. Though 
all types of psychotic symptoms are known to occur in manic or mixed episodes, grandiose delusions 
(e.g. being chosen by God, having special powers or abilities) and persecutory and self-referential 
delusions (e.g. being conspired against because of one’s special identity or abilities) are among 
the most common. Experiences of influence, passivity or control (e.g. thought insertion, thought 
withdrawal or thought broadcasting) may also occur during manic or mixed episodes. Hallucinations 
are less frequent and commonly accompany delusions of persecution or reference. They are usually 
auditory (e.g. adulatory voices), and less commonly visual (e.g. visions of deities), somatic or tactile. 
However, in a manic or mixed episode with psychotic symptoms, the psychotic symptoms are 
confined to the mood episode. Schizophrenia is differentiated from manic or mixed episodes in 
bipolar type I disorder by the occurrence of psychotic and other symptoms that meet the diagnostic 
requirements of schizophrenia during periods without mood symptoms that meet the diagnostic 
requirements of a manic or mixed episode. If the diagnostic requirements for both schizophrenia 
and bipolar type I disorder are met concurrently, and both psychotic and mood symptoms last for 
at least 1 month, schizoaffective disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder
In post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, severe flashbacks 
that involve a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings may occur, intrusive images 
or memories may have a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach proportions that 
appear to be paranoid. However, the diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder and complex 
post-traumatic stress disorder require a history of exposure to an event or series of events (either 
short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening or horrific nature. These diagnoses also require 
re-experiencing of the traumatic event in the present, in which the event is not just remembered but 
rather experienced as occurring again in the here and now, and may include loss of awareness and 
hallucination-like experiences within this specific context. Re-experiencing of traumatic events is not 
a characteristic feature of schizophrenia. However, post-traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia 
frequently co-occur, and both diagnoses should be assigned when the diagnostic requirements for 
each are met.
Schizoaffective disorder
Essential (required) features
• All diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia are met concurrently with mood symptoms 
that meet the diagnostic requirements of a moderate or severe depressive episode, a manic 
episode or a mixed episode. 
6A21
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizoaffective disorder

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Note: in making a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, depressive episodes must include 
depressed mood, not just diminished interest or pleasure.
•	 The onsets of the psychotic and mood symptoms are either simultaneous or occur within 
a few days of one another.
•	 The duration of symptomatic episodes is at least 1 month for both psychotic and mood 
symptoms.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a 
brain tumour), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol).
Course specifiers for schizoaffective disorder
The following specifiers should be applied to identify the course of schizoaffective disorder, 
including whether the individual currently meets the diagnostic requirements of schizoaffective 
disorder or is in partial or full remission. Course specifiers are also used to indicate whether the 
current episode is the first episode of schizoaffective disorder, whether there have been multiple 
such episodes, or whether symptoms have been continuous over an extended period of time.
Schizoaffective disorder, first episode
•	 The first episode specifier should be applied when the current or most recent episode is the 
first manifestation of the schizoaffective disorder meeting all diagnostic requirements in 
terms of symptoms and duration. If there has been a previous episode of schizoaffective 
disorder or schizophrenia, the multiple episodes specifier should be applied.
Schizoaffective disorder, first episode, currently symptomatic
•	 All diagnostic requirements for schizoaffective disorder in terms of symptoms and duration 
are currently met, or have been met within the past month.
•	 There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Note: if the duration of the episode is more than 1 year, the continuous specifier may be used 
instead, depending on the clinical situation.
Schizoaffective disorder, first episode, in partial remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for schizoaffective disorder have not been met within the 
past month, but some clinically significant symptoms remain, which may or may not be 
associated with functional impairment.
•	 There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Schizoaffective disorder, first episode, in full remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for schizoaffective disorder have not been met within the 
past month, and no clinically significant symptoms remain.
•	 There have been no previous episodes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Schizoaffective disorder, first episode, unspecified
Schizoaffective disorder, multiple episodes
•	 The multiple episodes specifier should be applied when there have been a minimum of two 
episodes meeting all diagnostic requirements of schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia 
in terms of symptoms, with a period of partial or full remission between episodes lasting 
at least 3 months, and the current or most recent episode is schizoaffective disorder. Note 
that the 1-month duration requirement for the first episode does not necessarily need to be 
met for subsequent episodes. During the period of remission, the diagnostic requirements 
of schizoaffective disorder are either only partially fulfilled or absent.
Schizoaffective disorder, multiple episodes, currently symptomatic
•	 All symptom requirements for schizoaffective disorder are currently met, or have been met 
within the past month. Note that the 1-month duration requirement for the first episode 
does not necessarily need to be met for subsequent episodes.
•	 There have been a minimum of two episodes of schizoaffective disorder or a previous 
episode of schizophrenia, with a period of partial or full remission between episodes 
lasting at least 3 months.

the disorder during the person’s lifetime since its first onset, with periods of subthreshold 
symptoms being very brief relative to the overall course. In order to apply this specifier to a 
first episode, the duration of schizoaffective disorder should be at least 1 year. In that case, 
the continuous specifier should be applied instead of the first episode specifier.
Schizoaffective disorder, continuous, currently symptomatic
•	 All symptom requirements for schizoaffective disorder are currently met, or have been met 
within the past month.
•	 Symptoms meeting the diagnostic requirements for schizoaffective disorder or 
schizophrenia have been present for almost all of the course of the disorder during the

Additional clinical features
•	 The onset of schizoaffective disorder may be acute, with serious disturbance apparent

•	 There is often a history of prior mood episodes and a previous diagnosis of a depressive 
disorder or a bipolar disorder in individuals with schizoaffective disorder.
•	 A prodromal phase often precedes the onset of psychotic symptoms by weeks or months. 
The characteristic features of this phase often include loss of interest in work or social 
activities, neglect of personal appearance or hygiene, inversion of the sleep cycle and 
attenuated psychotic symptoms, accompanied by negative symptoms, anxiety/agitation or 
varying degrees of depressive symptoms.

disorder, multiple persistent symptoms are present, and are typically accompanied by 
impairment in cognitive functioning and other psychosocial problems.
Course features
•	 Some people with schizoaffective disorder experience exacerbations and remission of 
symptoms periodically throughout the illness course, whereas others experience a full 
remission of symptoms between episodes.
Developmental presentations
•	 Diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder among children is challenging because the sequence 
of mood and psychotic symptoms may be difficult for children to describe accurately.
•	 Children who are diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder are the most severely impaired 
and have the poorest outcomes among all children diagnosed with psychotic disorders.
•	 Schizoaffective disorder with manic episodes is more common among young adults whereas 
schizoaffective disorder with depressive episodes is more common among older adults.
Culture-related features
•	 See the culture-related features section for schizophrenia, all of which also applies to 
schizoaffective disorder.
•	 In addition. culture may affect the expression of mood symptoms, the use of idioms of 
distress and illness-related metaphors, and the prominence of certain patterns of mood-
related symptoms. For example, religious or spiritual views about suicidal ideation or 
behaviour may decrease reporting and increase associated guilt; and shame may be more 
prominent than guilt in sociocentric societies. Norms for experiencing and articulating 
mood symptoms psychologically vary by culture, as does the attribution of distress to 
interpersonal, social, psychological, biological, supernatural or spiritual concerns.
•	 Bodily complaints as somatic expressions of depression may predominate over cognitive 
mood symptoms due to their greater cultural acceptability as indications of the need for 
clinical attention.

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Schizoaffective disorder is more prevalent among females – especially schizoaffective 
disorder with depressive episodes.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizophrenia
The diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are intended to apply to the current 
or most recent episode of the disorder. In other words, a previous diagnosis of schizoaffective 
disorder does not preclude a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and vice versa. In both schizophrenia and 
schizoaffective disorder, at least two the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia are present most of 
the time for a period of 1 month or more. In schizoaffective disorder, the symptoms of schizophrenia 
are present concurrently with mood symptoms that meet the full diagnostic requirements of a 
mood episode and last for at least 1 month, and the onsets of the psychotic and mood symptoms 
are either simultaneous or occur within a few days of one another. In schizophrenia, co-occurring 
mood symptoms, if any, either do not persist for as long as 1 month or are not of sufficient severity 
to meet the requirements of a moderate or severe depressive episode, a manic episode or a mixed 
episode. (See mood episode descriptions, p. 212.) An episode that initially meets the diagnostic 
requirements for schizoaffective disorder in which only the mood symptoms remit, so that the 
duration of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms is much longer than the duration of 
concurrent symptoms, may be best characterized as an episode of schizophrenia.
Boundary with mood episodes with psychotic symptoms
Schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, moderate or severe depressive episodes, manic episodes and 
mixed episodes are all intended to describe the current episode of the disorder. In schizoaffective 
disorder, the duration and symptom requirements for schizophrenia are fully met during the mood 
episode. In a depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms or a bipolar type I disorder with psychotic 
symptoms, psychotic symptoms occur simultaneously with the mood episodes but do not meet 
the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia (e.g. hallucinations without any other psychotic 
symptoms). It is possible for an individual to meet the diagnostic requirements for each during 
different periods.
Boundary with acute and transient psychotic disorder
In schizoaffective disorder, the psychotic symptoms persist for at least 1 month in their full, 
florid form. In contrast, in acute and transient psychotic disorder, the symptom requirements for 
schizophrenia or a depressive, manic or mixed episode are not met. Moreover, the symptoms in 
acute and transient psychotic disorder tend to fluctuate rapidly in intensity and type across time, 
such that the content and focus of delusions or hallucinations often shift, even on a daily basis. 
Negative symptoms may be present in schizoaffective disorder, but do not occur in acute transient 
psychotic disorder. The duration of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, 
and most often lasts from a few days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for 
schizoaffective disorder.

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Schizotypal disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 An enduring pattern of unusual speech, perceptions, beliefs and behaviours that are not 
of sufficient intensity or duration to meet the diagnostic requirements of schizophrenia, 
schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder is required for diagnosis. The pattern 
includes several of the following symptoms:
•	 constricted affect, such that the individual appears cold and aloof;
•	 behaviour or appearance that is odd, eccentric, unusual or peculiar, and is inconsistent 
with cultural or subcultural norms;
•	 poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal;
•	 unusual beliefs or magical thinking influencing the person’s behaviour in ways that are 
inconsistent with subcultural norms, but not reaching the diagnostic requirements for 
a delusion;
•	 unusual perceptual distortions such as intense illusions, depersonalization, derealization, 
or auditory or other hallucinations;
•	 suspiciousness or paranoid ideas;
•	 vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate or stereotyped thinking, manifested 
in odd speech without gross incoherence;
•	 obsessive ruminations without a sense that the obsession is foreign or unwanted, often 
with body dysmorphic, sexual or aggressive content.
•	 The individual has never met the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder or delusional disorder. That is, transient delusions, hallucinations, formal thought 
disorder, or experiences of influence, passivity or control may occur, but do not last for 
more than 1 month.
•	 Symptoms should have been present, continuously or episodically, for at least 2 years.
•	 The symptoms cause distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. corticosteroids) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol) – and are not better 
accounted for by another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder.
Additional clinical features
•	 Schizotypal disorder is more prevalent among biological relatives of people with a diagnosis 
of schizophrenia, and is considered to be a part of the spectrum of schizophrenia-related 
psychopathology. Having a first-degree relative with schizophrenia gives additional 
weight to a diagnosis of schizotypal disorder but is not a requirement if the individual is 
experiencing distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning related to their symptoms.
6A22
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizotypal disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The threshold between symptoms of schizotypal disorder and extravagant, eccentric or 
unusual behaviour and beliefs in individuals without a diagnosable disorder is sometimes 
difficult to determine, especially as some people in the general population show eccentric 
behaviour and report psychotic-like or unusual subjective experiences without any 
apparent impairment in functioning. Schizotypal disorder should only be diagnosed if the 
individual is experiencing distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning related to their symptoms.
Course features
•	 The course of schizotypal disorder is relatively stable and chronic, with some fluctuation 
in symptom intensity. Individuals often have severe functional impairments in academic, 
occupational and interpersonal domains.
•	 The following symptoms of schizotypal disorder are typically present prior to full 
symptomatic onset:
•	 poor rapport with others and a tendency towards social withdrawal, suspiciousness or 
paranoid ideas;
•	 vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, overelaborate or stereotyped thinking, manifested 
in odd speech without gross incoherence.
•	 The disorder may persist over years with fluctuations of intensity and symptom expression, 
but rarely evolves into schizophrenia.
•	 Affected individuals typically seek treatment for co-occurring depressive or anxiety and 
fear-related disorders. Although intervention has demonstrated some efficacy in improving 
mood and anxiety symptoms, suspicion and paranoia often persist.
Developmental presentations
•	 Schizotypal disorder typically begins in late adolescence or early adulthood, without a 
definite age of onset.
•	 Some symptoms of schizotypal disorder may first appear in childhood and adolescence, 
affecting peer relationships and academic performance.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Schizotypal disorder

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Culture-related features
•	 A person’s behaviour, appearance, speech or illness explanations may appear odd or 
unusual to clinicians who are unfamiliar with the person’s culture, but in the context of 
the person’s cultural group may be either normative or not sufficiently severe to reach 
the threshold of a mental disorder. Concepts and experiences that are common in some 
cultures include witchcraft or sorcery, speaking in tongues, life beyond death, shamanism, 
mind reading, sixth sense, evil eye, spirit possession and magical beliefs related to health 
and illness.
•	 Reduced engagement in interpersonal relationships may be part of some cultural or 
religious practices (e.g. monastic isolation) and should not be considered pathological.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
• Schizotypal disorder is slightly more prevalent among males.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizophrenia
In the prodromal and residual phases of schizophrenia, the individual may experience extended 
periods of perceptual distortions, unusual beliefs, odd or digressive speech, social withdrawal 
and other symptoms that are characteristic of schizotypal disorder. A diagnosis of schizophrenia, 
however, requires a period of at least 1 month of psychotic symptoms, in contrast to schizotypal 
disorder, which requires that any psychotic-like symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements 
for schizophrenia in terms of severity or duration. Moreover, the pattern of unusual speech, 
perceptions, beliefs and behaviours tends to be stable over time – even over years – in individuals 
with schizotypal disorder, in contrast to an evolving symptom picture either in prodromal or residual 
phases of schizophrenia.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Interpersonal difficulties seen in schizotypal disorder may share some features of autism spectrum 
disorder, including poor rapport with others and social withdrawal. However, individuals with 
schizotypal disorder do not exhibit restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, 
interests or activities.
Boundary with personality disorder
Personality disorder is defined as an enduring disturbance in the individual’s way of interpreting 
and experiencing themselves, others and the world that result in maladaptive patterns of emotional 
expression and behaviour, and produce significant problems in functioning that are particularly 
evident in interpersonal relationships. Individuals with schizotypal disorder should not be given an 
additional diagnosis of personality disorder based on disturbances in functioning and interpersonal

relationships that are entirely a consequence of the symptoms of schizotypal disorder. However, 
if additional personality features are present that are judged to produce significant problems in 
interpersonal functioning, an additional diagnosis of personality disorder may be appropriate.
Acute and transient psychotic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Acute onset of psychotic symptoms – which can include delusions, hallucinations, 
disorganized thinking or experiences of influence, passivity or control – that emerge 
without a prodrome, progressing from a non-psychotic state to a clearly psychotic state 
within 2 weeks, is required for diagnosis. Psychomotor disturbances may also be present, 
including catatonia.
•	 Symptoms change rapidly, both in nature and intensity. Such changes may occur from day 
to day, or even within a single day.
•	 Absence of negative symptoms (i.e. affective flattening, alogia or paucity of speech, 
avolition, asociality, anhedonia) is evident during the psychotic episode.
•	 The duration of the symptoms does not exceed 3 months, and most commonly lasts from 
a few days to 1 month.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. 
a brain tumour), are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol) – 
and are not better accounted for by schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder.
Course specifiers for acute and transient psychotic disorder
The following specifiers should be applied to identify the course of acute and transient psychotic 
disorder, including whether the individual currently meets the diagnostic requirements for the 
disorder or is in partial or full remission. If there have been no previous episodes of acute and 
transient psychotic disorder, the corresponding single episode specifier should be applied. If there 
have been multiple such episodes, the corresponding multiple episodes specifier should be applied.
Acute and transient psychotic disorder, first episode
• The first episode specifier should be applied when the current or most recent episode is the first 
manifestation of acute and transient psychotic disorder meeting all diagnostic requirements 
of the disorder.

Additional clinical features
•	 The onset of the acute and transient psychotic disorder is usually associated with a rapid 
deterioration in social and occupational functioning. Following remission, the person is 
generally able to regain the premorbid level of functioning.
•	 There are often other symptoms such as fluctuating disturbances of mood and affect, 
transient states of perplexity or confusion, or impairment of attention and concentration.
•	 An episode of acute stress preceding the onset of acute and transient psychotic disorder is 
commonly reported, but this is not a diagnostic requirement.
•	 If the symptoms last for more than 3 months, a different diagnosis should be considered, 
depending on the specific symptoms (e.g. schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, 
delusional disorder, other primary psychotic disorder).

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Acute and transient psychotic disorder

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Isolated unusual subjective experiences, such as experiences resembling hallucinations 
and delusions, are reported in the general population. However, in acute and transient 
psychotic disorder, the symptoms progress rapidly to full psychosis; they are usually 
polymorphic, fluctuating in quality and intensity (e.g. having features come and go in 
relatively rapid succession, or having the nature of a feature change over time, such as the 
focus or nature of a delusional belief); and usually fully remit within several weeks.
Course features
•	 Symptoms are brief in nature, lasting anywhere from a few days but not exceeding 3 months.
•	 Some individuals diagnosed with acute and transient psychotic disorder will go on to 
meet diagnostic requirements for another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, another 
primary psychotic disorder or a mood disorder.
•	 In general, favourable outcomes are associated with acute onset, short duration, good 
premorbid functioning and female gender.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of acute and transient psychotic disorders typically occurs between early and middle 
adulthood. However, the disorder may occur during adolescence or later in the lifespan, 
often following an episode of acute stress.
Culture-related features
•	 Migrant populations may be more likely to report these experiences. This may be due to 
higher prevalence as a result of migration-related stress, misattribution of psychosis by 
clinicians unfamiliar with cultural expressions of distress, or a combination of the two.
•	 In some cultures, distress due to social and other environmental circumstances may be 
expressed in ways that can be misinterpreted as psychotic symptoms (e.g. overvalued ideas 
and pseudo-hallucinations) but that instead are normative to the person’s subgroup.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Acute and transient psychotic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Acute and transient psychotic disorder is more prevalent among females.
•	 Male gender and younger age of acute and transient psychotic disorder onset appear to be 
associated with greater risk of subsequent development of schizophrenia.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder
The psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and in schizoaffective disorder last for at least 1 month 
in their full, florid form and tend to be more stable or fixed (e.g. having the same delusion for a 
period of months). In contrast, the symptoms in acute and transient psychotic disorder tend to 
fluctuate rapidly in intensity and type across time, such that the content and focus of delusions or 
hallucinations often shift, even on a daily basis. Negative symptoms may be present in schizophrenia 
and schizoaffective disorder, but do not occur in acute and transient psychotic disorder. The duration 
of acute and transient psychotic disorder does not exceed 3 months, and most often lasts from a few 
days to 1 month, compared to a much longer typical course for schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder. Finally, in contrast to schizophrenia, where the onset is often preceded by a history of poor 
premorbid adjustment, in acute and transient psychotic disorder the person’s symptoms progress 
rapidly without a prodromal period. In cases that meet both the diagnostic requirements for acute 
and transient psychotic disorder (i.e. fluctuating symptoms, acute onset, duration less than 3 months) 
and schizophrenia (e.g. delusions and hallucinations for more than 1 month) in the absence of a 
previous history of schizophrenia, a diagnosis of acute and transient psychotic disorder and not 
schizophrenia should be assigned.
Boundary with mood disorders with psychotic symptoms
Depressive and bipolar disorders are characterized by a predominant disturbance in mood that 
persists for at least several days and often much longer. Although mood symptoms may occur in 
acute and transient psychotic disorder, they are transient and do not meet the required duration or 
associated symptoms to qualify for a depressive, manic or mixed episode.
Boundary with acute stress reaction and dissociative disorders
Like acute and transient psychotic disorder, acute stress reaction and some dissociative disorders 
have an acute onset, often in response to a stressful life experience, and resolve in days to weeks. In 
contrast, by definition, acute and transient psychotic disorder includes psychotic symptoms like 
hallucinations or delusions that do not occur in disorders specifically associated with stress or in 
dissociative disorders.
Boundary with delirium
In delirium, the individual has a fluctuating clouding of consciousness (i.e. reduced ability to direct, 
focus, sustain and shift attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment). In 
contrast, in acute and transient psychotic disorder, the person maintains a regular level of alertness 
and relatively clear sense of consciousness, despite transient states of perplexity, confusion and 
impairment of attention or concentration.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Acute and transient psychotic disorder

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Delusional disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of a delusion or set of related delusions, typically persisting for at least 
3 months and often much longer, in the absence of a depressive, manic or mixed episode 
is required for diagnosis.
•	 The delusions are variable in content across individuals, while showing remarkable stability 
within individuals, although they may evolve over time. Common forms of delusions 
include persecutory, somatic (e.g. a belief that organs are rotting or malfunctioning despite 
normal medical examination), grandiose (e.g. a belief that one has discovered an elixir that 
gives eternal life), jealous (e.g. the unjustified belief that one’s spouse is unfaithful) and 
erotomanic (i.e. the belief that another person, usually a famous or high-status stranger, is 
in love with the person experiencing the delusion).
•	 Absence of clear and persistent hallucinations; severely disorganized thinking (formal 
thought disorder); experiences of influence, passivity or control; or negative symptoms 
characteristic of schizophrenia is evident. However, in some cases, specific hallucinations 
typically related to the content of the delusions may be present (e.g. tactile hallucinations 
in delusions of being infected by parasites or insects).
•	 Apart from the actions and attitudes directly related to the delusional system, affect, speech 
and behaviour are typically unaffected.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. 
corticosteroids) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol) – and are not better 
accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. another primary psychotic disorder, a mood 
disorder, an obsessive-compulsive or related disorder, an eating disorder).
Course specifiers for delusional disorder
The following specifiers should be applied to identify whether the individual currently meets the 
diagnostic requirements of delusional disorder or is in partial or full remission.
Delusional disorder, currently symptomatic
•	 All diagnostic requirements for delusional disorder in terms of symptoms and duration are 
currently met, or have been met within the past month.
6A24
6A24.0 
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Delusional disorder

Delusional disorder, in partial remission
•	 The full diagnostic requirements for delusional disorder have not been met within the 
past month, but some clinically significant symptoms remain, which may or may not be 
associated with functional impairment.
Note: this category may also be used to designate the re-emergence of subthreshold symptoms 
of delusional disorder following an asymptomatic period in a person who has previously met the 
diagnostic requirements for delusional disorder.
Delusional disorder, in full remission
• The full diagnostic requirements for delusional disorder have not been met within the past 
month, and no clinically significant symptoms remain.
Delusional disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Delusions may be accompanied by actions directly related to the content of the 
delusions – for example, stalking the loved person in the context of erotomania or filing 
lawsuits against those believed to be persecuting the person.
•	 Rarely, delusional disorder may occur at the same time (or closely associated in time) in 
two people who have a strong emotional or situational link. This condition is often referred 
to as “shared or induced delusional disorder” or “folie-à-deux”. In such cases, one person 
typically adopts the delusional belief of the other person, and the delusions may remit in 
the less dominant person when the two individuals are separated.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 A continuum of delusional beliefs, attenuated delusional beliefs, overvalued ideas, and 
unusual or eccentric beliefs has been observed in the general population. Such beliefs may 
be more common among people under conditions of adversity. People with delusional 
disorder may display greater psychological distress, greater preoccupation and a higher 
degree of conviction compared to people in the general population with beliefs that are 
similar in nature to beliefs that could be characterized as delusional.

6A24.2 
6A24.Z 
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Delusional disorder

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Course features
•	 Delusional disorder typically has a later onset and greater stability of symptoms than other 
psychotic disorders with delusional symptoms.
•	 Some individuals with delusional disorder will develop schizophrenia.
•	 Individuals are more likely to have a premorbid personality disorder prior to the onset of 
delusional disorder.
•	 Levels of functioning are typically better among individuals with delusional disorder 
compared to those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder.
•	 Individuals with delusional disorder are less likely to require hospitalization in comparison 
to individuals with either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
Developmental presentations
•	 Delusional disorder is more prevalent among older individuals.
•	 Individuals who experience delusional disorder in early adulthood are more likely to have 
a history of hallucinations and severe psychopathology during adolescence.
Culture-related features
•	 Cultural factors may influence the presentation and diagnosis of delusional disorder. 
For example, spirit possession or witchcraft beliefs may be normative in some but not 
other cultures.
•	 Individuals may present with a combination of delusions and overvalued ideas, both 
drawing on similar cultural idioms and beliefs.
•	 Diverse populations that experience persecution (e.g. torture, political violence, 
discrimination due to minority status) may report fears that may be misjudged as paranoid 
delusions; these may represent instead appropriate fears of recurrence of being persecuted 
or symptoms of co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder. Accurate diagnosis relies 
on obtaining historical information and considering the cultural context to discern the 
veracity of persecutory beliefs.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Delusional disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 There are no prominent gender differences in delusional disorder. However, males appear 
to have a younger age of onset and are more likely to have delusions of jealousy.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizophrenia
Both schizophrenia and delusional disorder may be characterized by persistent delusions. If other 
features are present that meet the diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia (i.e. persistent 
hallucinations, disorganized thinking, negative symptoms, disorganized or abnormal psychomotor 
behaviour, or experiences of influence, passivity or control), a diagnosis of schizophrenia may be 
made instead of a diagnosis of delusional disorder. However, hallucinations that are consistent with 
the content of the delusions and do not occur persistently (i.e. with regular frequency for 1 month or 
longer) are consistent with a diagnosis of delusional disorder rather than schizophrenia. Delusional 
disorder is generally characterized by relatively preserved personality and less deterioration and 
impairment in social and occupational functioning than schizophrenia, and individuals with 
delusional disorder tend to present for the first time at a later age. Individuals with symptom 
presentations consistent with delusional disorder (e.g. delusions and related, circumscribed 
hallucinations) but who have not met the minimum duration requirement of 3 months should 
not be assigned a diagnosis of schizophrenia, even though the combination of persistent delusions 
and related hallucinations technically meets diagnostic requirements for schizophrenia. Instead, 
a diagnosis of other specified primary psychotic disorder is more appropriate in such cases.
Boundary with mood disorders with psychotic symptoms
In depressive disorders with psychotic symptoms and bipolar disorders with psychotic symptoms, 
delusions may present during the course of the mood episodes. Although mood symptoms – 
especially depressed mood – can occur in delusional disorder, the diagnosis of delusional disorder 
requires that there are times when the person experiences the delusions in the absence of any 
mood disturbance.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, 
hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder), olfactory reference disorder and 
anorexia nervosa
A number of mental disorders (e.g. obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, 
hypochondriasis, olfactory reference disorder, anorexia nervosa) may involve a recurrent 
preoccupation with a belief that is demonstrably untrue or that is not shared by others (e.g. that 
ritualistically washing one’s hands prevents harm to loved ones, that a body part is defective, that 
one has a serious medical illness, that one emits a foul smell, that one is overweight) that may at 
times appear to be delusional in intensity, in the context of the other clinical features of that disorder. 
An additional diagnosis of delusional disorder should not be given if the belief occurs entirely in 
the context of symptomatic episodes of one of these other disorders and is fully consistent with its 
other clinical features.
Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders | Delusional disorder

Schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Boundary with dementia
Delusions – especially persecutory delusions – may occur as a symptom of dementia, particularly 
among older adults. Such delusions are differentiated from delusional disorder in that they have their 
onset during the dementia and are, by definition, due to another medical condition or prolonged 
substance use. In contrast, the delusions in delusional disorder must have had their onset prior 
to the onset of dementia. In cases where dementia has developed in someone with an established 
diagnosis of delusional disorder, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with delirium
Delusions may also be a prominent feature of delirium. In delirium, however, the individual also 
has a fluctuating clouding of consciousness (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift 
attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment). In contrast, in delusional 
disorder, there is no disturbance of attention or consciousness.
Other specified primary psychotic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by psychotic symptoms that share primary clinical 
features with disorders in the schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders 
grouping (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, formal thought disorder, grossly disorganized or 
catatonic behaviour).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements (e.g. in severity, frequency 
or duration) for any other disorder in the schizophrenia and other primary psychotic 
disorders grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. a mood disorder, a disorder specifically associated with 
stress, a dissociative disorder).
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned.
• The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a 
brain tumour), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system (e.g. corticosteroids), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

The contribution of each of these symptom domains can be recorded in the form of specifiers, 
which can be rated as not present/none (XS8H), mild (XS5W), moderate (XS0T) or severe (XS25), 
using the anchor points and descriptions provided in Tables 6.6–6.12 below. The ratings should be 
made based on the severity of the symptoms corresponding to that domain during the past week.
Each domain that contributes significantly to the individual clinical presentation should be rated. 
As many symptom specifiers should be applied as necessary to describe the current clinical 
presentation accurately. A symptom domain can also be recorded with unspecified severity – for 
example, if symptoms corresponding to a particular domain are present but insufficient information 
is available in order to rate their severity. In this case, the code for the symptom domain would be 
recorded (e.g. 6A25.0) without a severity rating.
In cases where multiple symptoms fall within a particular domain, the rating should reflect the 
most severe symptom within that domain. For example, hallucinations and delusions are both 
part of the positive symptoms domain. A person may experience hallucinations that result in 
minimal distress (indicative of mild positive symptoms) and delusions that affect the person’s 
behaviour but not to the point of impairing their functioning (indicative of moderate positive 
symptoms). In that case, the person’s positive symptoms should be rated as moderate. Note that 
individuals with primary psychotic disorders typically do not present with all the symptoms that 
are part of a given specifier domain. For example, in the positive symptoms domain, a person may 
present with only hallucinations, only delusions, both or neither. The descriptions corresponding 
to each rating in the tables below are intended to convey examples of symptom presentations 
that would justify a rating at a particular level of severity; they are not intended to be used as 
required criteria.
Specifier scales for symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Note that the mild, moderate and severe ratings for the depressive mood symptoms specifier are not 
equivalent to the corresponding diagnostic requirements for a mild, moderate or severe depressive 
episode. In other words, a rating of mild for depressive mood symptoms in the psychotic disorder 
specifiers does not indicate that the individual meets the requirements for a mild depressive 
episode. The same is true of the manic mood symptoms specifier. The rating of depressive and 
manic mood symptoms in these specifiers indicates the severity of depressed, elevated, or irritable 
mood, and does not include other symptoms (e.g. disrupted sleep, anhedonia, appetite change) 
that can occur as a part of mood episodes.
Symptom specifier ratings are intended to characterize the current clinical presentation among 
individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, and should 
not be used in individuals without such a diagnosis. Symptoms attributable to the direct 
pathophysiological consequences of a comorbid medical condition or injury not classified under 
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. a brain tumour or traumatic brain 
injury), or to the direct physiological effects of substances or medications (including withdrawal 
effects), should not be included in the specifier ratings. However, in individuals with schizophrenia 
and other primary psychotic disorders, the specific etiology of symptoms is often unclear (e.g. 
whether a mood symptom is due to the psychotic disorder or a result of substance use). In these 
cases, the relevant symptom should be considered in making the specifier rating until it becomes 
clear that the pathogenesis of the symptom is unrelated to the primary psychotic disorder.

Specifier scales for symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders

Specifier scales for symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic disorders
This specifier may be used together with a diagnosis from the grouping of schizophrenia and 
other primary psychotic disorders to indicate the degree to which positive psychotic symptoms 
are a prominent part of the current clinical presentation (see Table 6.7). Positive symptoms 
include delusions, hallucinations (most commonly verbal auditory hallucinations), disorganized 
thinking (formal thought disorder such as loose associations, thought derailment or incoherence), 
disorganized behaviour (behaviour that appears bizarre, purposeless and not goal-directed), and 
experiences of passivity and control (the experience that one’s feelings, impulses or thoughts 
are under the control of an external force). Abnormal psychomotor behaviour (e.g. catatonic 
restlessness or agitation, waxy flexibility, negativism) is not included in this domain but instead 
would be rated in the 6A25.4 Psychomotor symptoms domain below.
The rating should be made based on the severity of positive symptoms during the past week.

Example symptoms (not all are required)
Delusions
The person believes the delusion (lack of reality testing), but does not feel 
pressure to act upon it, and the delusion leads to minimal distress.
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are recurrent but relatively infrequent, and the person expresses 
only minimal distress regarding their content.
Experiences of passivity and control
Some distortions of self-experience are present, such as feeling that one’s 
thoughts are not one’s own, but these are relatively infrequent and there is only 
minimal associated distress.
Disorganized thinking
Some circumstantial or tangential thought processes are present, but for 
the most part the individual is able to convey the point of the intended 
communication.
Disorganized behaviour
Infrequent episodes of purposeless behaviour that is not goal-directed and 
causes only minimal impairment in functioning are present. 
Moderate
6A25.0&XS0T
Example symptoms (not all are required)
Delusions
The person’s behaviour is clearly affected by the delusional beliefs but the 
person’s behavioural response does not significantly impair functioning (e.g. 
a person with persecutory delusions is watchful of their surroundings but 
continues to venture outside).
Hallucinations
Hallucinations are relatively frequent and may be distressing at times but are 
tolerated at other times, and do not persistently preoccupy the person. The 
content of hallucinations may prompt action, but the person only inconsistently 
or occasionally responds, and these actions do not put the person or others at 
risk of harm.

Negative symptoms
This specifier may be used together with a diagnosis from the grouping of schizophrenia and 
other primary psychotic disorders to indicate the degree to which negative psychotic symptoms 
are a prominent part of the current clinical presentation (see Table 6.8). Negative symptoms 
include constricted, blunted or flat affect; alogia or paucity of speech; avolition (general lack 
of drive, or lack of motivation to pursue meaningful goals); asociality (reduced or absent 
engagement with others and interest in social interaction) and anhedonia (inability to experience 
pleasure from normally pleasurable activities). To be considered negative psychotic symptoms, 
relevant symptoms should not be entirely attributable to depression or to an understimulating 
environment, be a direct consequence of a positive symptom (e.g. persecutory delusions causing a 
person to become socially isolated due to fear of harm), or be attributable to the direct physiological 
effects of substances or medications, including withdrawal effects. Catatonia, including catatonic 
mutism, should be considered as part of the 6A25.4 Psychomotor symptoms domain below 
rather than here.
Severity
Anchor points
Experiences of passivity and control
Distortions of self-experience are relatively frequent and lead to some 
behaviours to ward against alteration of thoughts (e.g. superstitious rituals) or 
noticeable distress.
Disorganized thinking
Evidence of frequent circumstantial or tangential thought process that impairs 
the individual’s ability to convey the point of the communication.
Disorganized behaviour
Frequent episodes of purposeless behaviour that is not goal-directed and that 
causes some impairment in functioning.
Severe
6A25.0&XS25
Example symptoms (not all are required)
Delusions
The person is preoccupied with delusional beliefs that dictate many of their 
actions and significantly impair functioning (e.g. a person with persecutory 
delusions refuses to eat most food because of a conviction that food has been 
poisoned).
Hallucinations
The person is markedly distressed or preoccupied by frequent hallucinations, or 
there are recurrent hallucinations that prompt potentially harmful behaviour to 
which the person feels compelled to respond.
Experiences of passivity and control
Distortions of self-experience are markedly distressing, and significantly affect 
the individual’s behaviour (e.g. wearing a hat made of aluminium foil to prevent 
thought broadcasting).
Disorganized thinking
Loose associations in thought processes are present that are so severe that 
speech is mostly incoherent.
Disorganized behaviour
Purposeless behaviour that is not goal-directed dominates the individual’s 
behavioural repertoire, and causes severe impairment in functioning.

The rating should be made based on the severity of negative symptoms during the past week.
Depressive mood symptoms
This specifier may be used together with a diagnosis from the grouping of schizophrenia and 
other primary psychotic disorders to indicate the degree to which depressive mood symptoms are 
a prominent part of the current clinical presentation (see Table 6.9). The specifier refers only to 
depressive mood symptoms, as reported by the individual (feeling down, sad) or as observed by 
the clinician (e.g. tearful, defeated appearance). The severity of associated non-mood symptoms 
of a depressive episode (e.g. anhedonia or other negative symptoms, changes in sleep or appetite) 
should not be considered in making a rating for this specifier. In this regard, the depressive mood 
symptoms specifier is different from the severity rating applied to a depressive episode (see p. 216). 
If suicidal ideation is present, a rating of moderate or severe depressive mood symptoms should 
automatically be applied (see below). This specifier may be used regardless of whether the 
depressive symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode.

Mild
6A25.1&XS5W
Example symptoms (not all are required)
Blunted emotional experience or expression is present, with subtle but detectable 
affective changes. Initiation of speech is limited, but the individual is responsive 
to questions. The person shows little interest in external events, but exhibits 
sufficient motivation to engage in basic activities of daily living or to complete a 
task when prompted
Moderate
6A25.1&XS0T
Example symptoms (not all are required)
Flat emotional expression is present. Initiation of speech for purposes other 
than indicating immediate needs and desires is minimal, but the individual is 
responsive to questions with terse phrases. Lack of volition leads to neglect of 
hygiene or required activities, but the person will complete them with significant 
prompting.
Severe
6A25.1&XS25
Example symptoms (not all are required)
The person reports feeling empty or robotic most of the time. Generally the 
individual does not initiate speech, even to indicate immediate needs and desires. 
The person is not capable of initiating behaviour even with significant prompting, 
which may lead to serious neglect of self-care to the extent that it puts the 
person at risk of harm (e.g. infrequently taking life-sustaining medication).

Manic mood symptoms
This specifier may be used together with a diagnosis from the grouping of schizophrenia and 
other primary psychotic disorders to indicate the extent to which manic mood symptoms are 
a prominent part of the clinical presentation (see Table 6.10). The specifier includes elevated, 
euphoric, irritable or expansive mood states, including rapid changes among different mood 
states (i.e. mood lability). It also includes increased subjective experience of energy, which may be 
accompanied by increased goal-directed activity. The severity of associated non-mood symptoms 
of a manic or hypomanic episode (e.g. decreased need for sleep, distractibility) should not be 
considered in making a rating for this specifier. Increased non-goal-directed psychomotor activity 
should be considered as part of the 6A25.4 Psychomotor symptoms domain below rather than 
here. This specifier may be used regardless of whether the manic symptoms meet the diagnostic 
requirements for a manic episode.
The rating should be made based on the severity of manic mood symptoms during the past week.

Psychomotor symptoms
This specifier may be used together with a diagnosis from the grouping of schizophrenia and 
other primary psychotic disorders to indicate the degree to which psychomotor symptoms are 
a prominent part of the clinical presentation (see Table 6.11). Psychomotor symptoms include 
psychomotor agitation or increased motor activity, usually manifested in purposeless behaviours 
such as fidgeting, shifting, fiddling, inability to sit or stand still, wringing of the hands, stereotypy 
and grimacing. Psychomotor symptoms also include psychomotor retardation (a visible 
generalized slowing of movements and speech), as well as catatonic symptoms such as extreme 
restlessness with purposeless motor activity to the point of exhaustion, posturing, waxy flexibility, 
negativism, mutism or stupor. To be considered psychomotor symptoms for the purpose of 
this specifier rating, symptoms should not be attributable to a neurodevelopmental disorder or 
disease of the nervous system, or to the direct physiological effects of substances or medications, 
including withdrawal effects. If the full syndrome of catatonia is present, the diagnosis of 6A40 
Catatonia associated with another mental disorder (p. 202) should also be assigned.
The rating should be made based on the severity of psychomotor symptoms during the past week.

Cognitive symptoms
This specifier may be used together with a diagnosis from the grouping of schizophrenia and other 
primary psychotic disorders to indicate the degree to which cognitive impairment is a prominent 
aspect of the clinical presentation (see Table 6.12). Deficits may appear in any of the following 
cognitive domains: speed of processing, attention/concentration, orientation, judgement, 
abstraction, verbal or visual learning, or working memory. The cognitive impairment is not 
attributable to a neurodevelopmental disorder, to delirium or another neurocognitive disorder, 
or to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including 
withdrawal effects. When available, the severity rating for this domain should be based on the 
results of locally validated, standardized neuropsychological assessments, but such measures are 
not available in all settings and are not required to provide a rating.
The rating should be made based on the severity of cognitive symptoms during the past week.

Catatonia
Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances, characterized by the co-occurrence 
of several symptoms of decreased, increased or abnormal psychomotor activity. The assessment 
of catatonia is complex and requires observation, interview and physical examination. Catatonia 
can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and other primary 
psychotic disorders, mood disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders – especially autism 
spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal 
from certain psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens 
such as mescaline or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, 
or during the use of certain psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic 
medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Finally, catatonia can occur 
as a direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. Examples of medical conditions that may be 
associated with catatonia include diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, 
homocystinuria, neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease and encephalitis.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

General diagnostic requirements for catatonia
Essential (required) features
• The presence of three or more of the following symptoms of decreased, increased 
or abnormal psychomotor activity is required for diagnosis. The three symptoms 
may come from one or any combination of the following three symptom clusters.
Note: symptoms that require assessment by physical examination are indicated below.
Decreased psychomotor activity
•	 Staring: fixed gaze; decreased blinking, often with widely opened eyes
•	 Ambitendency: appearance of being “motorically stuck” in indecisive or hesitant 
movement
•	 Negativism: opposing or behaving contrary to requests or instructions, which may lead 
to withdrawal from interaction with others (turning away) or refusal to take food or 
drink when offered
•	 Stupor: immobility; no or markedly reduced psychomotor activity; minimally responsive 
to external stimuli
•	 Mutism: no or very little verbal response; speech that is hushed or whispered to the point of 
being unintelligible  (Note: do not count if speech symptoms are due to a disease of the 
nervous system, developmental speech or language disorder, or other disease or disorder 
affecting speech.)
Increased psychomotor activity
•	 Any of the following: extreme hyperactivity or agitation for no reason with nonpurposeful 
movements and/or uncontrollable, extreme emotional reactions; impulsivity (sudden 
engagement in inappropriate behaviour without provocation); combativeness (striking out 
against others usually in an undirected manner, with or without the potential for injury)
(Note: multiple manifestations of increased psychomotor activity should only be counted 
as one of the required three symptoms in order to meet the requirements for catatonia.)
Abnormal psychomotor activity
•	 Grimacing: odd or distorted facial expressions; often inappropriate and irrelevant to the 
situation
•	 Mannerisms: odd, purposeful movements that are not appropriate to the individual’s 
cultural context; exaggerated caricatures of mundane movements
•	 Posturing: spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity; sitting or 
standing for long periods without reacting
•	 Stereotypy: repetitive, non-goal-directed motor activity (e.g. finger-play, repeatedly 
touching, patting or rubbing self) (Note: the abnormality is not inherent in the action 
but relates to its frequency.)
•	 Rigidity: resistance by way of increased muscle tone, which may range in severity from 
mildly increased tone to severe “lead pipe” rigidity (requires examination)
•	 Echophenomena: mimicking examiner’s speech (echolalia) or movements (echopraxia)
•	 Verbigeration: continuous and directionless repetition of words, phrases or sentences
•	 Waxy flexibility: slight and even resistance to positioning by examiner (requires 
examination)
Catatonia | General diagnostic requirements for catatonia

Catatonia
Catatonia
•	 Catalepsy: passive induction of a posture (typically as examiner passively moves patient’s 
extremity), which remains held against gravity (requires examination)
• The symptoms typically last for at least several hours but can persist much longer. For 
some severe items (e.g. stupor, catalepsy, mutism, negativism) or if vital sign (autonomic) 
abnormality is present, a short duration (e.g. 15 minutes) may be sufficient to be considered 
a qualifying symptom.
• The symptoms result in significant impairment in daily functioning or are severe enough to 
cause serious medical complications (e.g. contractures, exhaustion, dehydration, aspiration) 
or risk of death resulting from autonomic abnormalities or complications (e.g. rigidity leading 
to renal failure from rhabdomyolysis).
• The symptoms are not better accounted for by a primary movement disorder classified in 
Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system.
Specifiers for autonomic abnormalities in catatonia
Catatonia may be accompanied by vital sign abnormalities not fully accounted for by a comorbid 
medical condition that may signal potentially life-threatening complications and therefore require 
immediate attention. These include tachycardia or bradycardia; hypertension or hypotension; 
and hyperthermia or hypothermia. In these cases, as many of the following symptom codes as 
applicable should be applied:
MG26	
Fever of other or unknown origin
MG28	
Hypothermia, not associated with low environmental temperature
MC80.0	
Elevated blood-pressure reading, without diagnosis of hypertension
MC80.1	
Nonspecific low blood-pressure reading
MC81.0	
Tachycardia, unspecified
MC81.1	
Bradycardia, unspecified.
Catatonia associated with another mental disorder
Essential (required) features
• The general diagnostic requirements for catatonia are met.
•	 The catatonic symptoms develop in the context of another mental disorder, such as 
schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder or autism spectrum 
disorder.
•	 The symptoms are not fully accounted for by delirium, the effects of a medication or 
substance – including withdrawal effects – or a primary movement disorder classified in 
Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system (e.g. Parkinson disease, Huntington disease).
•	 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.
Note: the associated mental disorder should be diagnosed separately.
Catatonia | Catatonia associated with another mental disorder
6A40

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
•	 Acute episodes of catatonia associated with another mental disorder typically develop 
rapidly within hours or days from single symptoms to full presentation.
•	 In catatonia associated with another mental disorder, symptoms most commonly resolve 
within 4 weeks, although some episodes (e.g. in the context of acute psychosis) may remit 
spontaneously within hours. However, symptoms may also persist for months or even 
years with little variation of the clinical presentation and severity.
•	 The individual may experience recurrent episodes of catatonia of several weeks’ duration 
that remit and recur throughout the course of the associated disorder. Most commonly, 
these catatonia episodes occur during some but not all of the episodes of the associated 
mental disorder (e.g. a bipolar disorder). Early signs of recurring episodes may include 
ambitendency or psychomotor slowing.
•	 Persistent catatonia is most commonly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or 
schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders. Adolescent onset is more frequent 
in these cases. Disturbances of volition – such as negativism, mannerisms or stereotyped 
movements – are more common in persistent catatonia, whereas stupor rarely persists 
over weeks. In some severe cases, persistent catatonia is characterized by severe, stable 
symptoms and massive global dysfunction for multiple years.
Catatonia induced by substances or medications
Essential (required) features
• The general diagnostic requirements for catatonia are met.
•	 The catatonic symptoms develop during or soon after intoxication with or withdrawal 
from a specified psychoactive substance, or use of a medication. Substances that may 
be associated with catatonia include opioids, PCP, cannabis, cocaine, MDMA or related 
drugs, and hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD. Catatonia may also be associated with 
certain psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, 
benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin).
•	 The intensity or duration of the catatonic symptoms is substantially in excess of similar 
symptoms that are characteristic of intoxication or withdrawal due to the specified 
substance (e.g. stupor during opioid intoxication; psychomotor agitation and autonomic 
hyperactivity during alcohol withdrawal).
•	 The specified substance, as well as the amount and duration of its use, must be capable of 
producing catatonic symptoms.
•	 The symptoms are not fully accounted for by delirium or another mental disorder (e.g. 
schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder or autism spectrum 
disorder), and are not the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition.
•	 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.
6A41
Catatonia | Catatonia induced by subtances or medications

Catatonia
Course features
• The onset of catatonia induced by substances or medications is typically rapid, often with 
fast deterioration. The duration of catatonia strongly depends on the inducing substance. 
Catatonia is more often induced by substance withdrawal than intoxication. Once the effects 
of the substance or medication (including a withdrawal syndrome) have subsided, catatonia 
typically remits within days.
Secondary catatonia syndrome
Essential (required) features
• The general diagnostic requirements for catatonia are met.
• The catatonic symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a 
medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory 
findings. This judgement depends on establishing that:
•	 the medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms of catatonia;
•	 the course of the catatonic symptoms (e.g. onset, remission, response of the symptoms 
to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the 
medical condition;
•	 the symptoms are not fully accounted for by delirium, another mental disorder (e.g. 
schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder or autism 
spectrum disorder), the effects of a medication or substance – including withdrawal 
effects – or a primary movement disorder classified in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous 
system (e.g. Parkinson disease, Huntington disease).
• The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.
Additional clinical features
• Catatonia symptoms that often cluster together in critically ill adults with secondary catatonia 
include mutism, staring and immobility.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
• The onset of secondary catatonia syndrome is related to the underlying medical condition, 
and duration is also determined by the underlying medical condition and its treatment.
•	 In cases in which the underlying disease course is severe and progressive (e.g. Alzheimer 
disease), secondary catatonia syndrome due to a disease of the nervous system or other 
medical condition may be chronic (lasting for weeks or months) and may fail to resolve 
fully with treatment of the underlying medical condition.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions
The identified etiological medical condition should be diagnosed separately.
Medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing catatonia syndromes include 
the following.
Primary brain disorders (examples)
•	 Neoplasms
•	 Cerebrovascular lesions, including cortical venous thrombosis, subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, subdural haematoma, bacillar aneurysms
•	 Anoxias, including stroke
•	 Viral encephalitis, encephalitis lethargica
•	 Brain stem, diencephalic and basal ganglia disorders, as well as frontal lobe or parietal 
lobe lesions
•	 Epilepsy
•	 Traumatic brain injury
•	 Dystonia
•	 Multiple sclerosis
•	 Parkinson disease
•	 Lewy body disease
•	 Human prion diseases
General medical conditions affecting the brain (examples)
• Autoimmune conditions
•	 Systemic lupus erythematosus
•	 Hashimoto encephalopathy or autoimmune encephalitis
• Infectious diseases
•	 Typhoid fever
•	 Infectious mononucleosis
•	 Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal 
infections (PANDAS)
•	 HIV/AIDS
Catatonia | Secondary catatonia syndrome

Catatonia
• Genetic conditions
•	 Prader-Willi syndrome
•	 Fatal familial insomnia
•	 Tay-Sachs disease
•	 Wilson disease
• Metabolic conditions
•	 Hypercalcaemia from a parathyroid adenoma
•	 Hepatic encephalopathy
•	 Homocystinuria
•	 Diabetic ketoacidosis
•	 Acute intermittent porphyria
•	 Membranous glomerulonephritis
•	 Hyponatraemia
•	 Hypo- and hyperthyroidism
•	 Hypo- and hyperadrenalism
• Nutritional deficiencies
•	 Pellagra
•	 Nicotinic acid deficiency
•	 Wernicke’s encephalopathy (thiamine deficiency)
•	 Vitamin B12 deficiency
Catatonia, unspecified
Developmental presentations for catatonia (all types)
•	 Catatonia may occur throughout the entire lifespan, but rarely develops before adolescence. 
However, severe cases in children aged 8–11 years have been reported.
•	 Early onset of catatonia (before age 20) is associated with underlying medical conditions, 
particularly diseases of the nervous system, or neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. autism 
spectrum disorder).
•	 Secondary catatonia syndrome or catatonia induced by substances or medications is more 
likely to occur after age 40; risk increases considerably after age 65.
•	 In medically ill adults, the prevalence of secondary catatonia syndrome increases with age 
and is strongly associated with co-occurring delirium or coma.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features for catatonia (all types)
• The incidence of catatonia appears to vary across cultures, and may occur in some cases 
in reaction to an overwhelming traumatic experience. Catatonia may be more frequent in 
some immigrant minority communities (e.g. refugees), including in children, where it may 
be associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorders.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential 
diagnosis) for catatonia (all types)
Boundary of catatonia induced by substances or medications with other types 
of catatonia
Evidence supporting a diagnosis of non-substance-induced catatonia would include catatonic 
symptoms preceding the onset of the substance use, the symptoms persisting for a substantial 
period of time after cessation of the substance or medication use or withdrawal (e.g. 1 month or 
more depending on the specific substance), or other evidence of a pre-existing mental disorder that 
may be associated with catatonic symptoms.
Boundary of catatonia associated with another mental disorder with psychomotor 
retardation in depressive or mixed episodes
Psychomotor retardation in depressive episodes and decreased psychomotor activity in catatonia can 
manifest in similar ways. In the presence of a depressive or mixed episode, an additional diagnosis 
of catatonia associated with another mental disorder is appropriate if symptoms of increased 
psychomotor activity or abnormal psychomotor activity are also present. If all catatonia symptoms 
are from the decreased psychomotor activity cluster, whether or not an additional diagnosis of 
catatonia associated with another mental disorder is assigned is a clinical judgement based on the 
severity of the symptoms and on whether catatonia is a specific focus of clinical attention.
Boundary of catatonia associated with another mental disorder with psychomotor 
agitation in depressive, manic or mixed episodes
Psychomotor agitation in a mood episode and increased psychomotor activity in catatonia can 
manifest in similar ways. In the presence of a mood episode, an additional diagnosis of catatonia 
associated with another mental disorder is only appropriate if symptoms of decreased psychomotor 
activity or abnormal psychomotor activity are also present. If all catatonia symptoms are aspects of 
increased psychomotor activity, an additional diagnosis of catatonia is not warranted.
Boundary of catatonia induced by substances or medications and secondary 
catatonia with delirium due to psychoactive substances, including medications, with 
delirium due to disease classified elsewhere
Both delirium and catatonia may be characterized by increased or decreased psychomotor activity. 
They are distinguished primarily by the disturbance of attention, awareness and arousal – as well as 
impairment in other cognitive domains – that characterize delirium and are not features of catatonia 
and the impairment of volition (e.g. ambitendency, negativism, mannerisms) and abnormal muscle 
tone (rigidity, waxy flexibility, catalepsy) that may occur in catatonia but not delirium.
Catatonia | Catatonia, unspecified

Catatonia
Boundary of catatonia with autonomic abnormality with neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome
Symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome include high fever, muscle stiffness, altered mental 
status and autonomic dysfunction (e.g. wide swings of blood pressure, excessive sweating, excessive 
secretion of saliva), most of which may also occur in catatonia with autonomic abnormality. 
A diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is based on the clinical judgement that exposure 
to an antipsychotic medication or other dopamine receptor-blocking agents is the cause of the 
symptoms. This distinction can be difficult because many individuals who develop catatonia take 
antipsychotic medication. It is made based on the timing of the symptoms in relation to medication 
use, prior history of multiple episodes of catatonia (in which case neuroleptic malignant syndrome is 
less likely), and sometimes the presence of certain medical complications that are not characteristic 
of catatonia, such as hyperkalaemia or liver or kidney failure.
Boundary of catatonia with serotonin syndrome
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation or restlessness and muscle rigidity, as well as 
autonomic disturbances such as high fever and tachycardia, which may also occur in catatonia. A 
diagnosis of serotonin syndrome involves the clinical judgement that exposure to a serotonergic 
medication or an interaction between serotonergic medications (e.g. when increasing the dose of a 
medication or adding a new medication) is the cause of the symptoms, based on the timing of the 
symptoms in relation to medication use. Serotonin syndrome is more likely to present with tremor, 
hyperactive muscle reflexes (including clonus) and nystagmus than catatonia. However, the presence 
of these symptoms does not exclude the possibility of co-occurring catatonia.
Boundary of catatonia with malingering or factitious disorder
Malingering and factitious disorder are both diagnosed based on evidence of feigning of symptoms, 
which may include catatonic symptoms. Evidence for feigning often includes the observation that 
the symptoms occur only when the person is being watched. However, disturbances of volition in 
catatonia (e.g. negativism) may only become apparent during social interactions, which should not 
by itself be interpreted as evidence of feigning.

Mood disorders
Mood disorders is a superordinate grouping of bipolar disorders and depressive disorders. Mood 
disorders are defined according to particular types of mood episodes and their pattern over time. 
The primary types of mood episodes are:
depressive episode
manic episode
mixed episode
hypomanic episode.
Mood episodes are not independently diagnosable entities, and therefore do not have their own 
diagnostic codes. Rather, mood episodes are the components of bipolar and related disorders and 
depressive disorders.
Bipolar and related disorders include the following:

Mood episode descriptions
Depressive episode
Essential (required) features
•	 The concurrent presence of at least five of the following characteristic symptoms occurring 
for most of the day, nearly every day, during a period lasting at least 2 weeks is required 
for diagnosis. At least one symptom from the affective cluster must be present. Assessment 
of the presence or absence of symptoms should be made relative to typical functioning of 
the individual.
Affective cluster
•	 Depressed mood as reported by the individual (e.g. feeling down, sad) or as observed 
(e.g. tearful, defeated appearance) (Note: in children and adolescents depressed mood 
can manifest as irritability.)
•	 Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities, especially those normally found 
to be enjoyable to the individual (Note: this may include a reduction in sexual desire.)
Cognitive-behavioural cluster
•	 Reduced ability to concentrate and sustain attention on tasks, or marked indecisiveness
•	 Beliefs of low self-worth or excessive and inappropriate guilt that may be manifestly 
delusional (Note: this item should not be considered present if guilt or self-reproach is 
exclusively about being depressed.)
•	 Hopelessness about the future
•	 Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation (with or 
without a specific plan), or evidence of attempted suicide
Mood disorders | Depressive episode
A category for mood disorders that do not fit the descriptions for any of the above categories is

GA34.41
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder

Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Depressive episode
Mood disorders
Neurovegetative cluster
•	 Significantly disrupted sleep (delayed sleep onset, increased frequency of waking during 
the night, or early morning awakening) or excessive sleep
•	 Significant change in appetite (diminished or increased) or significant weight change 
(gain or loss)
•	 Psychomotor agitation or retardation (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings 
of restlessness or being slowed down)
•	 Reduced energy, fatigue or marked tiredness following the expenditure of only a minimum 
of effort
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).
•	 The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.
•	 The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 In some individuals, the affective component of a depressive episode may be primarily 
experienced and expressed as irritability, or as an absence of emotional experience (e.g. 
“emptiness”). These variants in the expression of the affective component can be considered 
as meeting the depressed mood requirement for a depressive episode if they represent a 
significant change from the individual’s typical functioning.
•	 In some individuals – particularly those experiencing a severe depressive episode – there 
may be reluctance to describe certain experiences (e.g. psychotic symptoms) or inability 
to do so in detail (e.g. due to psychomotor agitation or retardation). In such cases, 
observations made by the clinician or reported by a collateral informant are important in 
determining the diagnostic status and severity of the episode.
•	 Depressive episodes may be associated with increased consumption of alcohol or 
other substances, exacerbation of pre-existing psychological symptoms (e.g. phobic or 
obsessional symptoms) or somatic preoccupations.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Some depression of mood is a normal reaction to severe adverse life events and problems (e.g. 
divorce, job loss), and is common in the community. A depressive episode is differentiated 
from this common experience by the severity, range and duration of symptoms. If the 
diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode listed above are met, a depressive episode 
should still be considered present, even if there are identifiable life events that appear to 
have triggered the episode.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mood disorders | Depressive episode
•	 A depressive episode should not be considered to be present if the individual is exhibiting 
normal grief symptoms, including some level of depressive symptoms, and the individual 
has experienced the death of a loved one within the past 6 months, or longer if a more 
extended period of bereavement is consistent with the normative response for grieving 
within the individual’s religious and cultural context. Individuals with no history of 
depressive episodes may experience depressive symptoms during bereavement, but this 
does not appear to indicate an increased risk of subsequently developing a mood disorder. 
However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on normal grief. The presence of a 
depressive episode during a period of bereavement is suggested by persistence of constant 
depressive symptoms 1 month or more following the loss (i.e. there are no periods of 
positive mood or enjoyment of activities); severe depressive symptoms, such as extreme 
beliefs of low self-worth and guilt not related to the lost loved one; or presence of psychotic 
symptoms, suicidal ideation or psychomotor retardation. A prior history of depressive 
disorder or bipolar disorder is important to consider in making this distinction.
Developmental presentations
•	 Depressive episodes are relatively rare in childhood, and occur with similar frequency 
among boys and girls. Rates increase significantly after puberty, and girls are approximately 
twice as likely as boys to experience a depressive episode.
•	 All the characteristic features of a depressive episode can be observed in children and 
adolescents. As in adults, symptoms of a depressive episode should represent a change from 
prior functioning. Assessment of a depressive episode in younger children in particular is 
likely to rely on the report of other informants (e.g. parents) regarding signs and symptoms 
and the extent to which these represent a change from prior functioning.
Affective cluster
•	 In young children, depressed mood may present as somatic complaints (e.g. headaches, 
stomach pains), whining, increased separation anxiety or excessive crying. Depressed 
mood may sometimes present in children and adolescents as pervasive irritability. 
However, the presence of irritability is not in and of itself indicative of a depressive episode 
and may indicate the presence of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental 
disorder, or be a normal reaction to frustration.
Cognitive-behavioural cluster
•	 As noted, reduced ability to concentrate or sustain attention may manifest as a decline 
in academic performance, increased time needed to complete school assignments or 
an inability to complete assignments. These symptoms of a depressive episode must 
be differentiated from problems with attention and concentration in attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder that are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy.
Neurovegetative cluster
•	 Hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more common symptoms of a depressive episode in 
adolescents than in adults. Appetite disturbance in children and adolescents may manifest 
in failure to gain weight as expected for age and development rather than as weight loss.
•	 As with adults, children and adolescents experiencing a depressive episode are at increased 
risk of suicidality. In younger children, suicidality may manifest in passive statements (e.g. 
“I don’t want to be here any more”) or as themes of death during play, whereas adolescents 
may make more direct statements regarding their desire to die.

Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Depressive episode
Mood disorders
•	 Self-injurious behaviours that are not explicitly suicidal in terms of lethality or expressed 
intent may also occur in a depressive episode in young children and adolescents. 
Examples include head banging or scratching in young children and cutting or burning 
in adolescents. If unaddressed, these types of behaviours tend to increase in frequency 
and intensity over time among children and adolescents with depressive disorders.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with mixed episode
Depressive symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a depressive 
episode, but in a mixed episode several prominent depressive symptoms occur simultaneously or 
alternate rapidly with several prominent manic symptoms such as irritability, racing or crowded 
thoughts, increased talkativeness or increased activity.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Problems with attention and concentration in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are persistent 
over time (i.e. are not episodic) and are not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy. However, 
mood disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both diagnoses may 
be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with prolonged grief disorder
Prolonged grief disorder is a persistent and pervasive grief response following the death of a partner, 
parent, child or other person close to the bereaved that persists for an abnormally long period of 
time following the loss (e.g. at least 6 months). It is characterized by longing for the deceased or 
persistent preoccupation with the deceased accompanied by intense emotional pain (e.g. sadness, 
guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty accepting the death, feeling one has lost a part of one’s self, 
inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness, difficulty in engaging with social or 
other activities). Some common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder are similar to those observed 
in a depressive episode (e.g. sadness, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, feelings of guilt, 
suicidal ideation). However, prolonged grief disorder is differentiated from a depressive episode 
because symptoms are circumscribed and specifically focused on the loss of the loved one, whereas 
depressive thoughts and emotional reactions typically encompass multiple areas of life. Further, 
other common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder (e.g. difficulty accepting the loss, difficulty 
trusting others, feeling bitter or angry about the loss, feeling as though a part of the individual has 
died) are not characteristic of a depressive episode. The timing of the onset of the symptoms in 
relation to the loss and whether there is a prior history of a depressive disorder or a bipolar disorder 
are important to consider in making this distinction.
Boundary with dementia
Older adults experiencing a depressive episode may present with memory difficulties and other 
cognitive symptoms, which can be severe, and it is important to distinguish these symptoms 
from dementia. Dementia is an acquired chronic condition characterized by significant cognitive 
impairment or decline from a previous level of cognitive functioning in two or more cognitive 
domains (e.g. memory, attention, executive function, language, social cognition, psychomotor speed, 
visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to interfere with performance 
or independence in activities of daily living. If memory difficulties and other cognitive symptoms 
in older adults occur exclusively in the context of a depressive episode, a diagnosis of dementia 
is generally not appropriate. However, a depressive episode can be superimposed on dementia 
(e.g. when memory difficulties and other cognitive symptoms substantially predate the onset 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mood disorders | Depressive episode
of the depressive episode). The timing and rate of onset of the memory difficulties and other 
cognitive symptoms in relation to other depressive symptoms are important to consider in making 
this distinction.
Severity and psychotic symptoms specifiers
The severity of all current depressive episodes should be rated based on the number and severity of 
the symptoms, as well as the impact that the mood disturbance has on the individual’s functioning.
In addition, moderate and severe depressive episodes are described as “without psychotic 
symptoms” (i.e. delusions or hallucinations) or “with psychotic symptoms”. By definition, mild 
depressive episodes do not include psychotic symptoms.
Delusions during moderate or severe depressive episodes are commonly persecutory or self-
referential (e.g. being pursued by authorities because of imaginary crimes). In addition, 
delusions of guilt (e.g. falsely blaming oneself for wrongdoing), poverty (e.g. being bankrupt) 
and impending disaster (perceived to have been brought on by the individual), as well as somatic 
(e.g. of having contracted some serious disease) or nihilistic delusions (e.g. believing body 
organs do not exist) are known to occur. Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivity 
or control (e.g. the experience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are being 
placed in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being 
broadcast to others) can also occur, but less commonly than in schizophrenia and schizoaffective 
disorder. Auditory hallucinations (e.g. derogatory or accusatory voices that berate the patient for 
supposed weaknesses or sins) are more common than visual (e.g. visions of death or destruction) 
or olfactory hallucinations (e.g. the smell of rotting flesh).
Psychotic symptoms are often subtle, and the boundary between psychotic symptoms and 
persistent depressive ruminations or sustained preoccupations is not always clear. Psychotic 
symptoms may vary in intensity over the course of a depressive episode or even over the course 
of the day. Psychotic symptoms may be intentionally concealed by individuals experiencing 
a depressive episode.
Mild depressive episode
•	 None of the symptoms of a depressive episode should be present to an intense degree.
•	 The individual is usually distressed by the symptoms, and has some difficulty in continuing 
to function in one of more domains (personal, family, social, educational, occupational 
or other important domains).
•	 There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.
Moderate depressive episode without psychotic symptoms
•	 Several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a large 
number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.
•	 The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains 
(personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).
•	 There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.
Moderate depressive episode with psychotic symptoms
•	 Several symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or a large 
number of depressive symptoms of lesser severity are present overall.

Mood disorders
Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Manic episode
•	 The individual typically has considerable difficulty functioning in multiple domains 
(personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).
•	 There are delusions or hallucinations during the episode.
Severe depressive episode without psychotic symptoms
•	 Many or most symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or 
a smaller number of symptoms are present and manifest to an intense degree.
•	 The individual has serious difficulty continuing to function in most domains (personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).
•	 There are no delusions or hallucinations during the episode.
Severe depressive episode with psychotic symptoms
•	 Many or most symptoms of a depressive episode are present to a marked degree, or 
a smaller number of symptoms are present and manifest to an intense degree.
•	 The individual has serious difficulty continuing to function in most domains (personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational or other important domains).
•	 There are delusions or hallucinations during the episode.
Manic episode
Essential (required) features
•	 Both of the following features occur concurrently and persist for most of the day, nearly 
every day, during a period of at least 1 week, unless shortened by a treatment intervention.
•	 An extreme mood state is observable or reported, characterized by euphoria, irritability 
or expansiveness that represents a significant change from the individual’s typical mood. 
Individuals commonly exhibit rapid changes among different mood states (i.e. mood 
lability).
•	 Increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy is present, and represents 
a significant change from the individual’s typical level.
•	 Several of the following symptoms are present, representing a significant change from the 
individual’s usual behaviour or subjective state:
•	 increased talkativeness or pressured speech (a feeling of internal pressure to be 
more talkative);
•	 flight of ideas or experience of rapid or racing thoughts (e.g. thoughts flow rapidly and, 
in some cases, illogically from one idea to the next; the person reports that their thoughts 
are rapid or even racing and has difficulty remaining on topic);
•	 increased self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g. the individual believes that they can accomplish 
tasks well beyond their skill level, or that they are about to become famous – in psychotic 
presentations of mania, this may be manifested in grandiose delusions);
•	 decreased need for sleep (e.g. the person reports being able to function with only 
2 or 3 hours of sleep), as distinct from insomnia, in which an individual wants to sleep 
but cannot;

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mood disorders | Manic episode
•	 distractibility (e.g. the person cannot stay on task, because attention is drawn to irrelevant 
or minor environmental stimuli, such as being overly distracted by outside noise during 
a conversation);
•	 impulsive reckless behaviour (e.g. the individual impulsively pursues pleasurable activities 
without regard to their potential for negative consequences, or impulsively makes major 
decisions in the absence of adequate planning);
•	 an increase in sexual drive, sociability or goal-directed activity.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. cocaine, amfetamines), including withdrawal effects.
•	 The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.
•	 The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, requires intensive 
treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, or is accompanied by 
delusions or hallucinations.
Additional clinical features
•	 Manic episodes may or may not include psychotic symptoms. A wide variety of psychotic 
symptoms may occur in mania; among the most common are grandiose delusions (e.g. 
being chosen by God, having special powers or abilities), persecutory delusions and 
self-referential delusions (e.g. being conspired against because of one’s special identity 
or abilities). Delusions related to experiences of influence, passivity or control (e.g. the 
experience that thoughts or actions are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s 
mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcast 
to others) may also occur. Hallucinations are less frequent, and commonly accompany 
delusions of persecution or reference. They are usually auditory (e.g. adulatory voices), and 
less commonly visual (e.g. visions of deities), somatic or tactile.
•	 Some patients may exhibit symptoms or impairment in functioning that is sufficiently 
severe to require immediate intervention (e.g. treatment with mood-stabilizing 
medications). As a result, their symptoms may not meet the full duration requirement of 
a manic episode. Episodes that meet the full symptom requirements but last for less than 
1 week because they are shortened by a treatment intervention should still be considered 
manic episodes.
•	 A manic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication, 
electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should be 
considered a manic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued and 
the full diagnostic requirements of a manic episode are met after the direct physiological 
effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.

Mood disorders
Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Manic episode
Boundary with normality (threshold)
• Periods of euphoric or irritable mood that are entirely contextually appropriate (e.g. euphoria 
after winning a lottery) should not be considered as meeting the mood component of the 
diagnostic requirements for a manic episode.
Developmental presentations
•	 Manic episodes are rare in childhood and adolescence. It is normal for children to display 
overexcitement, exuberance or silliness in contexts such as special occasions, celebrations or 
some types of play. A manic episode should only be considered when these behaviours are 
episodic and recurrent (or characterized by rapid onset if a first episode), are inappropriate 
for the context in which they arise, are in excess of what might be expected given the 
person’s age or developmental level, represent a distinct change from previous functioning, 
and are associated with significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational or 
other important areas of functioning.
•	 When a manic episode occurs in children or adolescents, all the characteristic features can 
be observed. The reports of other informants (e.g. parents) are particularly important in the 
case of children in evaluating the nature of symptoms and the extent to which they represent 
a change from previous functioning. The extreme mood state characteristic of a manic 
episode may manifest as extreme irritability in children and adolescents. Younger children 
may exhibit excessive or severe tantrums or increased physical aggression (e.g. throwing 
things or hitting).
•	 In children and adolescents, increased distractibility may manifest as a decline in academic 
performance, increased time needed to complete school assignments or an inability to 
complete assignments.
•	 Increased self-esteem or grandiosity associated with a manic episode should be 
differentiated from children’s normal tendency to overestimate their abilities and believe 
that they have special talents. Grandiose beliefs that are held with clear evidence to the 
contrary or acted on in such a way that they place the child in danger are more suggestive of 
a manic episode. Examples of manifestations of grandiosity include magical or unrealistic 
ideas (e.g. thinking they can fly) in younger children or overestimation of abilities or 
talents based on current functioning (e.g. believing they should coach their high school 
sports team) in adolescents.
•	 Specific manifestations of increased goal-directed activities associated with a manic 
episode may differ across ages. For example, a younger child might build elaborate projects 
with blocks, while an adolescent might disassemble electronics or appliances.
•	 As in adults, children and adolescents may engage in impulsive reckless behaviours during 
a manic episode, but these are likely to present differently in children and adolescents 
based on behavioural repertoire and access to specific activities. For example, a child may 
exhibit risky play, disregarding possible injury (e.g. running into a busy street, climbing a 
tall tree, trying to fly), whereas for adolescents, analogous behaviour may include driving

Mood disorders | Mixed episode
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hypomanic episode
The symptoms of manic episodes may be qualitatively similar to those of hypomanic episodes but, 
unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to result in significant 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of 
functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, 
or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.
Boundary with mixed episode
Manic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a manic episode, but in 
a mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly with 
several prominent depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, 
hopelessness or suicidal ideation.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Many features of a manic episode – such as increased activity, rapid speech and over-talkativeness, 
distractibility and impulsivity – can be observed in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder. Differentiating between these disorders can be particularly challenging among children 
and adolescents. However, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, symptoms have their onset 
before the age of 12 years, are persistent over time (i.e. are not episodic), and are not temporally 
tied to changes in mood or energy (e.g. are not accompanied by intense mood elevation). However, 
rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are substantially elevated compared to the general 
population among children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorders, and both diagnoses 
may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Mixed episode
Essential (required) features
•	 Several prominent manic and several prominent depressive symptoms consistent with 
those observed in manic episodes and depressive episodes are present, which either 
occur simultaneously or alternate very rapidly (from day to day or within the same day). 
Symptoms must include an altered mood state consistent with a manic and/or depressive 
episode (i.e. depressed, dysphoric, euphoric or expansive mood), and be present most 
of the day, nearly every day, during a period of at least 2 weeks, unless shortened by a 
treatment intervention.
•	 When manic symptoms predominate in a mixed episode, common depressive (contrapolar) 
symptoms are dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, hopelessness and 
suicidal ideation.
•	 When depressive symptoms predominate in a mixed episode, common manic (contrapolar) 
symptoms are irritability, racing or crowded thoughts, increased talkativeness and 
increased activity.

Mood disorders
Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Mixed episode
•	 When depressive and manic symptoms alternate rapidly during a mixed episode, such 
fluctuations may be observed in mood (e.g. between euphoria and sadness or dysphoria), 
emotional reactivity (e.g. between flat affect and intense or exaggerated reactiveness to 
emotional stimuli), drive (e.g. alternating periods of increased and decreased activity, 
verbal expression, sexual desire or appetite) and cognitive functioning (e.g. periods of 
activation and inhibition or slowing of thoughts, attention and memory).
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from cocaine).
•	 The mood disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, or is accompanied by 
delusions or hallucinations.
Additional clinical features
•	 Delusions and hallucinations characteristic of both depressive and manic episodes (see 
above) can occur in mixed episodes.
•	 A mixed syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication, 
electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should be 
considered a mixed episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is discontinued and 
the full diagnostic requirements of a mixed episode are met after the direct physiological 
effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.
Developmental presentations
•	 Research regarding mixed episodes in children and adolescents is limited; however, some 
evidence suggests that adolescents with bipolar disorders may be more likely than adults 
with bipolar disorders to experience mixed episodes.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with manic episode
Manic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a manic episode, but 
in a mixed episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly 
with several depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, 
hopelessness or suicidal ideation.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode
Boundary with depressive episode
Depressive symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a depressive 
episode, but in a mixed episode several prominent depressive symptoms occur simultaneously or 
alternate rapidly with several prominent manic symptoms such as irritability, racing or crowded 
thoughts, increased talkativeness or increased activity.
Boundary with hypomanic episode
Manic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a hypomanic episode 
but, unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance in a mixed episode is sufficiently severe 
to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent 
harm to self or others, or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations. Moreover, in a mixed 
episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly with several 
prominent depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, 
hopelessness or suicidal ideation, which are not characteristic of a hypomanic episode.
Hypomanic episode
Essential (required) features
•	 Both of the following symptoms occur concurrently and persist for most of the day, nearly 
every day, for at least several days.
•	 Persistent elevation of mood or increased irritability is observable or reported, and 
represents a significant change from the individual’s usual range of moods (e.g. the change 
would be apparent to people who know the individual well). This does not include periods 
of elevated or irritable mood that are contextually appropriate (e.g. elevated mood after 
graduating from school or related to falling in love). Rapid shifts among different mood 
states commonly occur (i.e. mood lability).
•	 Increased activity or a subjective experience of increased energy is present, and represents 
a significant change from the individual’s typical level.
•	 In addition, several of the following symptoms are present, representing a significant 
change from the individual’s usual behaviour (e.g. the change would be apparent to others 
who know the individual well) or subjective state:
•	 increased talkativeness or pressured speech (a feeling of internal pressure to be more 
talkative);
•	 flight of ideas or experience of rapid or racing thoughts (e.g. thoughts flow rapidly from 
one idea to the next; the person reports that their thoughts are rapid or even racing and 
has difficulty remaining on a topic);
•	 increased self-esteem or grandiosity (e.g. the individual is more self-confident than usual);
•	 decreased need for sleep (e.g. the person reports needing less sleep than usual and still feels 
well-rested), as distinct from insomnia, in which an individual wants to sleep but cannot;
•	 distractibility (e.g. the person has difficulty staying on task, because attention is drawn 
to irrelevant or minor environmental stimuli, such as being overly distracted by outside 
noise during a conversation);

Mood disorders
Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode
•	 impulsive reckless behaviour (e.g. the individual pursues pleasurable activities with little 
regard to their potential for negative consequences, or makes decisions in the absence 
of adequate planning);
•	 an increase in sexual drive, sociability or goal-directed activity.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. cocaine, amfetamines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).
•	 The clinical presentation does not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for a mixed episode.
•	 The mood disturbance is not sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in 
occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others, and is 
not accompanied by delusions or hallucinations.
Additional clinical features
•	 A hypomanic syndrome arising during antidepressant treatment (medication, 
electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) should 
be considered a hypomanic episode if the syndrome persists after the treatment is 
discontinued and the full diagnostic requirements of a hypomanic episode are met after 
the direct physiological effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Hypomanic episodes are often difficult to distinguish from normal periods of elevated 
mood – for example, related to positive life events – particularly given that hypomanic 
episodes are not associated with significant functional impairment. In order to be 
considered a hypomanic episode, the symptoms must represent a significant and noticeable 
change from the individual’s typical mood and behaviour.
•	 The occurrence of one or more hypomanic episodes in the absence of a history of other 
types of mood episodes (manic, depressive or mixed episodes) is not a sufficient basis for 
a diagnosis of a mood disorder.
Developmental presentations
•	 As in adults, hypomanic episodes in children and adolescents are similar to – but less severe 
than – manic episodes, and may present for a shorter period of time. The information 
in the section on developmental presentations for manic episode, above, is therefore also 
applicable to hypomanic episode.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mood disorders | Hypomanic episode
•	 Hypomanic episodes may be difficult to distinguish from developmentally normative 
behaviours in children and adolescents (e.g. changes in sleep or irritability during 
adolescence). Factors to consider include the episodicity and a marked, co-occurring, 
change in cognitions (e.g. racing thoughts) or behaviours (e.g. increased activity level).
•	 Increased irritability in younger children may manifest as excessive or more severe 
tantrums or increased physical aggression (e.g. throwing things, or hitting).
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with manic episode
The symptoms of hypomanic episodes may be qualitatively similar to those of manic episodes, 
but the mood disturbance is not sufficiently severe to result in marked impairment in personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning, or to require 
intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent harm to self or others, and is not accompanied 
by delusions or hallucinations.
Boundary with mixed episode
Manic symptoms in a mixed episode may be qualitatively similar to those of a hypomanic episode 
but, unlike in a hypomanic episode, the mood disturbance in a mixed episode is sufficiently severe 
to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning or to require intensive treatment (e.g. hospitalization) to prevent 
harm to self or others, or is accompanied by delusions or hallucinations. Moreover, in a mixed 
episode several prominent manic symptoms occur simultaneously or alternate rapidly with several 
prominent depressive symptoms such as dysphoric mood, expressed beliefs of worthlessness, 
hopelessness or suicidal ideation, which are not characteristic of a hypomanic episode.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Many features of a hypomanic episode – such as increased activity, rapid speech and over-
talkativeness, distractibility and impulsivity – can be observed in individuals with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder. Differentiating between these disorders can be particularly challenging 
among children and adolescents. However, in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, symptoms 
have their onset before the age of 12 years, are persistent over time (i.e. are not episodic), and are 
not temporally tied to changes in mood or energy (e.g. are not accompanied by mood elevation). 
However, rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are substantially elevated compared to the 
general population among children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorders, and both 
diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.

Mood disorders | Bipolar type I disorder
Bipolar and related disorders
Bipolar and related disorders are episodic mood disorders defined by the occurrence of manic, 
mixed or hypomanic episodes or symptoms. These typically alternate over the course of these 
disorders with depressive episodes or periods of depressive symptoms.
Because the symptoms of bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders are substantially similar 
apart from the occurrence of manic or mixed episodes in bipolar type I disorder and hypomanic 
episodes in bipolar type II disorder, following a separate listing of the essential features for each of 
these disorders, the other CDDR sections (e.g. additional clinical features, boundaries with other 
disorders and conditions) are provided for both disorders together.
Bipolar type I disorder
Essential (required) features
• A history of at least one manic or mixed episode (see above essential features for mood 
episodes) is required for diagnosis. Although a single manic or mixed episode is sufficient 
for a diagnosis of bipolar type I disorder, the typical course of the disorder is characterized 
by recurrent depressive and manic or mixed episodes. Although some episodes may be 
hypomanic, there must be a history of at least one manic or mixed episode.
Type of current mood episode, severity and psychotic symptoms in 
current depressive episodes, and remission specifiers
The type of current mood episode, the severity and presence or absence of psychotic symptoms 
in current depressive episodes, and the degree of remission should be described in bipolar 
type I disorder. (See descriptions of psychotic symptoms and depressive episode severity in mood

recurrent mood episodes. More than half of manic episodes will be immediately followed 
by a depressive episode.
•	 The risk of recurrence of mood episodes in bipolar type I disorder increases with the 
number of prior mood episodes.
• Individuals with bipolar type I disorder are at increased lifetime risk of suicidality.

Sex- and/or gender-related features for bipolar type I disorder
•	 Prevalence rates for bipolar type I disorder are similar between men and women, with a 
tendency for men to exhibit earlier onset of symptoms.
•	 Manic episodes occur more commonly in men, and are typically more severe and 
impairing. In contrast, women are more likely to experience depressive episodes, mixed 
episodes and rapid cycling.
•	 Disorders due to substance use often co-occur with bipolar type I disorder among men, 
whereas women are more likely to experience comorbid medical conditions including 
migraines, obesity and thyroid disease, as well as co-occurring mental disorders including 
anxiety and fear-related disorders and eating disorders.
•	 An additional diagnosis of 6E20 Mental and behavioural disorders associated with

Course features for bipolar type II disorder
•	 Bipolar type II disorder has its onset most often during the mid-20s; however, onset during 
late adolescence and throughout early and mid-adulthood may also occur. Initial onset of 
bipolar type II disorder in older adults is rare.
•	 While onset typically begins following a single depressive episode, some individuals 
experience several depressive episodes before occurrence of a hypomanic episode.
•	 The presence of chronic and gradually worsening experiences of affective lability or mood 
swings, particularly during adolescence and early adulthood, has been associated with an 
increased risk of developing bipolar type II disorder.
•	 Up to 15% of individuals with bipolar type II disorder will subsequently develop a manic 
episode, resulting in a change of diagnosis to bipolar type I disorder.
•	 Spontaneous intra-episode shifts from a depressive episode to a hypomanic episode are 
not uncommon.
•	 Risk of recurrence increases with each subsequent mood episode.
Sex- and/or gender-related features for bipolar type II disorder
•	 Women are more likely to experience hypomanic episodes, mixed episodes and rapid 
cycling. The time of greatest risk of a hypomanic episode is during the early postpartum 
period following childbirth. Approximately half of those who experience postpartum 
hypomanic symptoms will later develop a depressive disorder. Differentiating between

puerperium, without psychotic symptoms may be assigned to indicate that the current 
episode is perinatal.
Symptomatic and course presentation specifiers for mood episodes 
in bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders
Additional specifiers may be applied to describe a current mood episode in the context of bipolar 
type I disorder (depressive, manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes) and bipolar type II disorder 
(depressive or hypomanic episodes). These specifiers indicate other important features of the 
clinical presentation or of the course, onset and pattern of mood episodes. These specifiers are 
not mutually exclusive, and as many may be added as apply. (Note that these same specifiers may 
also be applied to current depressive episodes in the context of depressive disorders, with the 
exception of rapid cycling, which is specific to bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders.)
Available specifiers are as follows:
with prominent anxiety symptoms
•	 This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current depressive, manic, mixed 
or hypomanic episode, prominent and clinically significant anxiety symptoms (e.g. 
feeling nervous, anxious or on edge, not being able to control worrying thoughts, fear 
that something awful will happen, having trouble relaxing, muscle tension, autonomic 
symptoms) have been present for most of the time during the episode. If there have been 
panic attacks during the current depressive or mixed episode, these should be recorded 
separately (see the with panic attacks specifier). When the diagnostic requirements for 
both a mood episode and an anxiety or fear-related disorder are met, the anxiety or fear-
related disorder should also be diagnosed.
with panic attacks
•	 This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current episode, there have been panic 
attacks during the past month that occur specifically in response to depressive ruminations 
or other anxiety-provoking cognitions. If panic attacks occur exclusively in response to 
such thoughts, the with panic attacks specifier should be applied rather than an additional 
co-occurring diagnosis of panic disorder. If some panic attacks over the course of the 
depressive or mixed episode have been unexpected and not exclusively in response to 
depressive or anxiety-provoking thoughts, and the full diagnostic requirements for panic 
disorder are met, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be assigned.

Mood disorders
Mood disorders | Bipolar type II disorder
current depressive episode persistent
•	 This specifier can be applied if the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode are 
currently met and have been met continuously (five or more characteristic symptoms 
occurring most of the day, nearly every day) for at least the past 2 years.
current depressive episode with melancholia
•	 This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current depressive episode, several of 
the following symptoms have been present during the worst period of the current episode:
•	 loss of interest or pleasure in most activities that are normally enjoyable to the individual 
(i.e. pervasive anhedonia);
•	 lack of emotional reactivity to normally pleasurable stimuli or circumstances (i.e. mood 
does not lift even transiently with exposure);
•	 terminal insomnia (i.e. waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time);
•	 depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning;
•	 marked psychomotor retardation or agitation;
•	 marked loss of appetite or loss of weight.
with seasonal pattern of mood episode onset
•	 This specifier can be applied to bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder if there has been 
a regular seasonal pattern of onset and remission of at least one type of episode (i.e. 
depressive, manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes). The other types of mood episodes may 
not follow this pattern.
•	 A substantial majority of the relevant mood episodes should correspond with the seasonal 
pattern.
•	 A seasonal pattern should be differentiated from an episode that is coincidental with a 
particular season but predominantly related to a psychological stressor that regularly 
occurs at that time of the year (e.g. seasonal unemployment).
with rapid cycling
•	 This specifier can be applied if the bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder is characterized 
by a high frequency of mood episodes (at least four) over the past 12 months. There may be 
a switch from one polarity of mood to the other, or the mood episodes may be demarcated 
by a period of remission.
•	 In individuals with a high frequency of mood episodes, some may have a shorter duration 
than those usually observed in bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder. In particular, 
depressive periods may only last several days. However, if depressive and manic symptoms 
alternate very rapidly (i.e. from day to day or within the same day), a mixed episode should 
be diagnosed rather than rapid cycling.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mood disorders | Bipolar disorders
In the context of bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder, mood episodes that occur during 
pregnancy or commence within about 6 weeks after delivery (the puerperium) can be identified 
using one of the following two additional diagnostic codes, depending on whether delusions, 
hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms are present. These diagnoses should be assigned in 
addition to the relevant bipolar disorder diagnosis.
Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, without psychotic symptoms
•	 This additional diagnostic code should be used for mood episodes that arise during 
pregnancy or commence within about 6 weeks after delivery, and that do not include 
delusions, hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms. This designation should not be 
used to describe mild and transient depressive symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic 
requirements for a depressive episode, which may occur soon after delivery (so-called 
“postpartum blues” or “baby blues”). (See p. 640 for complete diagnostic requirements.)
Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, with psychotic symptoms
•	 This additional diagnostic code should be used for mood episodes that arise during 
pregnancy or commence within about 6 weeks after delivery, and that include delusions, 
hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms. (See p. 642 for complete diagnostic 
requirements.)
Note: for the following sections, see also material under depressive episode (p. 212), manic episode 
(p. 217), mixed episode (p. 220) and hypomanic episode (p. 222). Material on additional clinical 
features, boundary with normality (threshold), developmental presentations and boundaries 
with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) that relates specifically to the mood 
episodes is contained in those sections, whereas material focusing on bipolar type I and bipolar 
type II disorders overall appears below.
Additional clinical features for bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders
•	 In combination with a history of one or more depressive episodes, a mixed, manic 
or hypomanic episode arising during antidepressant treatment (e.g. medication, 
electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation) is grounds for 
a diagnosis of bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder if the syndrome persists after the 
treatment is discontinued and the full diagnostic requirements of the mood episode are 
met after the direct physiological effects of the treatment are likely to have receded.
•	 Inter-episode periods may be characterized by complete remission of symptoms or by the 
presence of residual hypomanic, manic, mixed or depressive symptoms, in which case the 
partial remission specifier should be applied.
•	 Suicide risk is significantly higher among individuals diagnosed with bipolar type I and 
bipolar type II disorders than among the general population, particularly during depressive 
or mixed episodes and among individuals with rapid cycling.
6E21
6E20

Mood disorders
•	 Recurrent panic attacks in bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders may be indicative of 
greater severity, poorer response to treatment and greater risk of suicide.
•	 Family history is an important factor to consider because heritability of bipolar disorders 
is the highest of all mental disorders.
•	 When individuals with bipolar type II disorder seek clinical services, they almost invariably 
do so during depressive episodes. Given that individuals experiencing a hypomanic episode 
often have a subjective experience of improved functioning (e.g. greater productivity and 
creativity at work), they rarely seek clinical care during such episodes. Thus, hypomanic 
episodes usually must be assessed retrospectively in individuals presenting with 
depressive symptoms.
•	 Individuals initially diagnosed with bipolar type II disorder are at high risk of experiencing 
a manic or mixed episode during their lifetime. If this occurs, the diagnosis should be 
changed to bipolar type I disorder.
•	 Patients diagnosed with bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders are at elevated risk 
of developing a variety of medical conditions affecting the cardiovascular system (e.g. 
hypertension) and metabolism (e.g. hyperglycaemia), some of which may be due to the 
effects of the chronic use of medications used to treat bipolar disorders.
•	 Individuals with bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder exhibit high rates of co-occurring 
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, most commonly anxiety and fear-
related disorders and disorders due to substance use.
Boundary with normality (threshold) for bipolar type I and bipolar 
type II disorders
•	 The presence or history of hypomanic episodes in the absence of a history of at least 
one depressive episode is not a sufficient basis for a presumptive diagnosis of bipolar 
type II disorder.
Culture-related features for bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders
•	 Studies indicate that the prevalence of bipolar and related disorders varies across cultural, 
ethnic and migrant groups, partly as a function of social stress. Symptom expression 
may also vary and be shaped by common cultural idioms, cultural histories or personal 
histories that are prominent in identity formation and expressed as grandiose ideas or 
beliefs. For example, grandiosity may be expressed in culturally specific ways such that 
a Muslim individual experiencing a manic episode may believe they are Muhammad, 
whereas a Christian individual may believe they are Jesus. Individuals from the person’s 
cultural group may be helpful in distinguishing normative expressions of belief or ritual 
from manic or psychotic experiences and behaviours.
•	 In some cultural contexts, mood changes are more readily expressed in the form 
of bodily symptoms (e.g. pain, fatigue, weakness) rather than directly reported as 
psychological symptoms.
•	 The perceived abnormality or acceptability of depressive symptoms may vary across 
cultures, affecting symptom detection and treatment acceptability. For example, some 
social groups or age cohorts may consider depressive symptoms to be normal reactions to 
adversity, depending on their tolerance of negative emotions or social withdrawal.
Mood disorders | Bipolar disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Some types of symptoms may be considered more shameful or severe according to cultural 
norms, leading to reporting biases. For example, some cultures may emphasize shame more 
than guilt, whereas in others suicidal behaviour and thinking may be prohibited or highly 
stigmatized. In some cultural groups, features such as sadness and lack of productivity may 
be perceived as signs of personal weakness and therefore be underreported.
•	 The cultural salience of depressive symptoms may vary across social groups as a result of 
varying cultural “scripts” for the disorder, which make specific types of symptoms more 
prominent. For example, psychological (e.g. sadness, emotional numbness, rumination), 
moral (e.g. guilt, worthlessness), social/interpersonal (e.g. lack of productivity, conflictive 
relationships), hedonic (e.g. decreased pleasure), spiritual (e.g. dreams of dead relatives) or 
somatic (e.g. insomnia, pain, fatigue, dizziness) symptoms may systematically predominate 
among specific cultural or social groups.
•	 Symptoms attributed to cultural concepts of distress may be evoked when asking about 
depressive symptomatology. Among Chinese people, for example, symptoms of shenjing 
shuairuo, or weakness of the nervous system (e.g. weakness, headache, bodily aches, fatigue, 
feeling vexed, loss of face) may be commonly reported. Culturally related symptoms and 
idioms of distress may complicate detection of depressive disorders and assessment of 
severity, including whether psychotic symptoms are present. Examples include pain in 
heart, soul loss, aching heart, complaints related to “nerves” and heat inside the body. In 
some cultures, a focus on a particular observable behaviour (e.g. “thinking too much”) 
may be what is reported.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential 
diagnosis) for bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders
Boundary with cyclothymic disorder
In cyclothymic disorder, the number, severity and/or duration of depressive symptoms have 
never met the threshold required for a depressive episode, and there is no evidence of a history of 
mixed or manic episodes.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Although a manic, hypomanic or mixed episode may include symptoms characteristic of attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder – such as distractibility, hyperactivity and impulsivity – bipolar type 
I and bipolar type II disorders are differentiated from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
by their episodic nature and the accompanying elevated, euphoric or irritable mood. However, 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders can co-
occur. When they do, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend to worsen during 
hypomanic, manic or mixed episodes.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with both bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders can exhibit psychotic symptoms 
during depressive episodes, and individuals with bipolar type I disorder can exhibit psychotic 
symptoms during manic or mixed episodes, but these symptoms occur only during mood episodes. 
Conversely, individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders 
may experience significant depressive or manic mood symptoms during psychotic episodes. In 
such cases, if the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive, manic or 
mixed episode, their presence and severity in the context of a psychotic disorder diagnosis can 
be denoted by applying specifier scales from symptomatic manifestations of primary psychotic 
Mood disorders | Bipolar disorders

Mood disorders
disorders – i.e. the depressive mood symptoms specifier in primary psychotic disorders (see 
p. 195) or the manic mood symptoms specifier in primary psychotic disorders (see p. 196). If all 
diagnostic requirements for both a depressive, manic or mixed episode and schizophrenia are 
met concurrently or within a few days of each other, and other diagnostic requirements are met, 
the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be assigned rather than bipolar type I or bipolar 
type II disorder. A hypomanic episode superimposed on schizophrenia does not qualify for a 
diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. However, a diagnosis of bipolar type I or bipolar type II 
disorder can co-occur with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, 
and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met and 
psychotic symptoms are present outside of mood episodes.
Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disorders
Symptoms of anxiety, including panic attacks, are common in bipolar type I and bipolar type II 
disorders, and in some individuals may be a prominent aspect of the clinical presentation. In 
such cases, the with prominent anxiety symptoms specifier should be applied to the diagnosis 
for non-panic anxiety systems. If the anxiety symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for 
an anxiety or fear-related disorder, the appropriate diagnosis from the anxiety or fear-related 
disorders grouping should also be assigned. For panic attacks, if these occur entirely in the 
context of anxiety associated with depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed episodes in bipolar 
type I and bipolar type II disorders, they are appropriately designated using the with panic attacks 
specifier. However, if panic attacks also occur outside of symptomatic mood episodes, and other 
diagnostic requirements are met, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. 
Both specifiers may be assigned if warranted.
Boundary with personality disorder
Individuals with a personality disorder may exhibit impulsivity or mood instability, but 
personality disorder does not include depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed episodes. However, 
co-occurrence of personality disorder and bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders is relatively 
common. Symptoms of personality disorder should be assessed outside the context of a mood 
episode to avoid conflating symptoms of a mood episode with personality traits, but both 
diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
It is common, particularly among children and adolescents, for patterns of noncompliance and 
symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of a mood disorder. For example, noncompliance 
may be a result of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities, difficulty 
concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). During hypomanic or 
manic episodes, individuals are less likely to follow rules and comply with directions. Oppositional 
defiant disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, and irritability/anger can be a common 
symptom across these disorders. When the behaviour problems occur primarily in the context 
of hypomanic, manic, depressive or mixed episodes, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant 
disorder should not be assigned. However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic 
requirements for each are met, and the behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant 
disorder are observed outside the occurrence of a mood episode. The oppositional defiant disorder 
with chronic irritability-anger specifier may be used if appropriate.
Boundary with substance-induced mood disorder
A depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed syndrome due to the effects of a substance or medication 
other than antidepressant medication on the central nervous system (e.g. cocaine, amfetamines) – 
including withdrawal effects – should be diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disorder rather 
than bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder. The presence of continuing mood disturbance 
should be assessed once the physiological effects of the relevant substance subside.
Mood disorders | Bipolar disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with other mental disorders
Irritability is a symptom that is also observed in other disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, 
generalized anxiety disorder). In order to attribute this symptom to a manic, hypomanic or mixed 
episode, the clinician should establish the episodicity of the symptom and its co-occurrence with 
other symptoms consistent with a manic, hypomanic or mixed episode.
Boundary with secondary mood syndrome
A depressive, hypomanic, manic or mixed syndrome that is a manifestation of another medical 
condition should be diagnosed as secondary mood syndrome rather than bipolar type I or bipolar 
type II disorder.
Cyclothymic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Mood instability over an extended period of time (i.e. 2 years or more) characterized 
by numerous hypomanic and depressive periods is required for diagnosis. (In children 
and adolescents depressed mood can manifest as pervasive irritability.) Hypomanic 
periods may or may not have been sufficiently severe or prolonged to meet the diagnostic 
requirements for a hypomanic episode.
•	 Mood symptoms are present for more days than not. While brief symptom-free intervals 
are consistent with the diagnosis, there have never been any prolonged symptom-free 
periods (e.g. lasting 2 months or more) since the onset of the disorder.
•	 There is no history of manic or mixed episodes.
•	 During the first 2 years of the disorder, there has never been a 2-week period during which 
the number and duration of symptoms were sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements 
for a depressive episode.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hyperthyroidism), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. stimulants), including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent mood instability 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant 
additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 In children, it may be appropriate to assign the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder after a 
somewhat briefer period of initial symptoms (e.g. 1 year).
Mood disorders | Cyclothymic disorder
6A62

Mood disorders
•	 Individuals initially diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder are at high risk of developing 
bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder during their lifetime.
•	 Individuals with cyclothymic disorder do not typically exhibit psychotic symptoms.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Cyclothymic disorder is distinguished from normal variations in mood by a history of 
distress or difficulty functioning due to repeated occurrences of mood disturbance.
Course features
•	 The course of cyclothymic disorder is often gradual and persistent. Onset of cyclothymic 
disorder commonly occurs during adolescence or early adulthood, and may be difficult 
to differentiate from normal mood instability associated with hormonal changes that 
accompany puberty.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of cyclothymic disorder in children typically occurs before the age of 10 years. 
Symptoms of irritability (particularly during periods of low mood) and sleep disturbance 
are often the prominent clinical features and reasons for consultation.
•	 Cyclothymic disorder is underdiagnosed in children and adolescents despite evidence for 
greater prevalence of this disorder in this age group compared to bipolar type I and bipolar 
type II disorders. However, the most common trajectory in children and adolescents is 
symptom remission; only a minority will maintain the diagnosis into adulthood or be at 
high risk of developing bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder.
•	 Co-occurrence of other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders is common 
among children and adolescents with cyclothymic disorder – particularly attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder.
Mood disorders | Cyclothymic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Little information is available about cultural influences on cyclothymic disorder. The 
information on culture-related features for bipolar type I and bipolar type II disorders 
(p. 237) may be relevant.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder
During the first 2 years of the disorder, depressive periods in cyclothymic disorder should not 
be sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode. Outside this 2-year 
period, there may be instances in which the symptoms are severe enough to constitute a depressive 
episode. In such cases, if there is no history of hypomanic episodes, single episode depressive 
disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may be diagnosed along with cyclothymic disorder.
Boundary with bipolar type I disorder
If the number and severity of symptoms reaches the diagnostic threshold for a manic episode 
or a mixed episode in the context of an ongoing cyclothymic disorder, the diagnosis should be 
changed to bipolar type I disorder.
Boundary with bipolar type II disorder
If the number and severity of symptoms reaches the diagnostic threshold for single episode 
depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder in the context of an ongoing cyclothymic 
disorder, and the individual has a history of hypomanic episodes but no history of manic or 
mixed episodes, the diagnosis should be changed to bipolar type II disorder.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Although hypomanic symptoms overlap with symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
– such as distractibility, hyperactivity and impulsivity – hypomanic episodes are differentiated 
from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder by their episodic nature and the accompanying 
elevated, euphoric or irritable mood. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and cyclothymic 
disorder can co-occur; when this occurs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms tend 
to worsen during hypomanic episodes.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
It is common, particularly among children and adolescents, for patterns of noncompliance and 
symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of a mood disorder. For example, noncompliance 
may be a result of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities, difficulty 
concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). Individuals may be less 
likely to follow rules and comply with directions when experiencing hypomanic symptoms. In 
contrast, individuals with oppositional defiant disorder do not exhibit the episodicity characteristic 
of cyclothymic disorder. However, oppositional defiant disorder often co-occurs with mood 
Mood disorders | Cyclothymic disorder

Mood disorders
disorders, and irritability/anger can be a common symptom across these disorders. When the 
behaviour problems occur primarily in the context of mood disturbance, a separate diagnosis of 
oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned. However, both diagnoses may be assigned 
if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, and the behaviour problems associated 
with oppositional defiant disorder are observed outside of periods of mood disturbance. The 
oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger specifier may be used if appropriate.
Boundary with personality disorder
Individuals with personality disorder may exhibit impulsivity or mood instability, but cyclothymic 
disorder does not include persistent problems in self-functioning and interpersonal dysfunction 
that characterize personality disorder. Personality disorder should be assessed outside the context 
of a mood episode to avoid conflating symptoms of a mood episode with personality traits, but 
both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each are fulfilled.
Boundary with secondary mood syndrome
Chronic mood instability that is a manifestation of another medical condition should be diagnosed 
as secondary mood syndrome rather than cyclothymic disorder.
Boundary with substance-induced mood disorder
Chronic mood instability due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants), should be 
diagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder rather than cyclothymic disorder.
Other specified bipolar or related disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by manic or hypomanic symptoms (with or without 
depressive symptoms) that share primary clinical features with other bipolar and related 
disorders (e.g. persistent elevation of mood).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
bipolar and related disorders grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. schizoaffective disorder, a disorder due to addictive 
behaviours, a personality disorder).
•	 The symptoms and behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g. alcohol, cocaine) on the central 
nervous system, including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.

Depressive disorders
Depressive disorders are characterized by depressive mood (e.g. feeling sad, irritable, empty) 
or loss of pleasure accompanied by other cognitive, behavioural or neurovegetative symptoms 
that significantly affect the individual’s ability to function. A depressive disorder should not be 
diagnosed in individuals who have ever experienced a manic, mixed or hypomanic episode, 
which would indicate the presence of a bipolar disorder.
Because the presentation of single episode depressive disorder is the same as that of recurrent 
depressive disorder apart from a history of prior depressive episodes, following a separate listing 
of the essential features for each of these disorders, the other CDDR sections (e.g. additional 
clinical features, boundaries with other disorders and conditions) are provided for both 
disorders together.
Single episode depressive disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence or a history of a single depressive episode (see above essential features) is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 There is no history of manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes, which would indicate the 
presence of a bipolar disorder.
Severity, psychotic symptoms and remission specifiers
The depressive episode in single episode depressive disorder should be classified according to 
the severity of the episode or the degree of remission. Moderate and severe episodes should also 
be classified according to the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms. (See the descriptions 
of episode severity and psychotic symptoms in depressive episodes on p. 216.) Available 
categories are:

Symptomatic and course presentations for mood episodes in single 
episode and recurrent depressive disorders
Additional specifiers may be applied to describe the presentation and characteristics of a current 
depressive episode in the context of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive 
disorder. These specifiers indicate other important features of the clinical presentation or of the 
course, onset and pattern of depressive episodes. These specifiers are not mutually exclusive, and 
as many may be added as apply. (Note that these same specifiers may also be applied to current 
depressive episodes in the context of bipolar type I or bipolar type II disorder.)
Available specifiers are as follows:
with prominent anxiety symptoms
•	 This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current depressive episode, prominent 
and clinically significant anxiety symptoms (e.g. feeling nervous, anxious or on edge, not 
being able to control worrying thoughts, fear that something awful will happen, having 
trouble relaxing, muscle tension, autonomic symptoms) have been present for most of the 
time during the episode. If there have been panic attacks during the current depressive 
episode, these should be recorded separately (see the with panic attacks specifier). When 
the diagnostic requirements for both a depressive episode and an anxiety or fear-related 
disorder are met, the anxiety or fear-related disorder diagnosis should also be diagnosed.

with panic attacks
•	 This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current depressive episode, there have 
been panic attacks during the past month that occur specifically in response to depressive 
ruminations or other anxiety-provoking cognitions. If panic attacks occur exclusively in 
response to such thoughts, the with panic attacks specifier should be applied rather than 
an additional co-occurring diagnosis of panic disorder. If some panic attacks over the 
course of the depressive episode have been unexpected and not exclusively in response to 
depressive thoughts, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be assigned.
current depressive episode persistent
•	 This specifier can be applied if the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode are 
currently met and have been met continuously (five or more characteristic symptoms 
occurring most of the day, nearly every day) for at least the past 2 years.
current depressive episode with melancholia
•	 This specifier can be applied if, in the context of a current depressive episode, several of 
the following symptoms have been present during the worst period of the current episode:
•	 loss of interest or pleasure in most activities that are normally enjoyable to the individual 
(i.e. pervasive anhedonia);
•	 lack of emotional reactivity to normally pleasurable stimuli or circumstances (i.e. mood 
does not lift even transiently with exposure);
•	 terminal insomnia, i.e. waking in the morning 2 hours or more before the usual time;
•	 depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning;
•	 marked psychomotor retardation or agitation;
•	 marked loss of appetite or loss of weight.
with seasonal pattern of mood episode onset
•	 This specifier can be applied to recurrent depressive disorder if there has been a regular 
seasonal pattern of onset and remission of depressive episodes.
•	 A substantial majority of depressive episodes should correspond with the seasonal pattern.
•	 A seasonal pattern should be differentiated from an episode that is coincidental with a 
particular season but predominantly related to a psychological stressor that regularly 
occurs at that time of the year (e.g. seasonal unemployment).
In the context of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, depressive 
episodes that occur during pregnancy or commence within about 6 weeks after delivery (the 
puerperium) can be identified using one of the following two additional diagnostic codes, 
depending on whether delusions, hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms are present. These 
diagnoses should be assigned in addition to the relevant depressive disorder diagnosis.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, without psychotic symptoms
•	 This additional diagnostic code should be used for mood episodes that arise during 
pregnancy or commence within about 6 weeks after delivery, and that do not include 
delusions, hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms. This designation should not be 
used to describe mild and transient depressive symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic 
requirements for a depressive episode, which may occur soon after delivery (so-called 
“postpartum blues” or “baby blues”). (See p. 640 for complete diagnostic requirements.)
Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, with psychotic symptoms
•	 This additional diagnostic code should be used for mood episodes that arise during 
pregnancy or commence within about 6 weeks after delivery, and that include delusions, 
hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms. (See p. 642 for complete diagnostic 
requirements.)
Note: for the following sections, see also material under depressive episode (p. 212), manic episode 
(p. 217), mixed episode (p. 220) and hypomanic episode (p. 222). Material on additional clinical 
features, boundary with normality (threshold), developmental presentations and boundaries 
with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) that relates specifically to the mood 
episodes is contained in those sections, whereas material focusing on single episode depressive 
disorder and recurrent depressive disorder overall appears below.
Additional clinical features for single episode depressive disorder 
and recurrent depressive disorder
•	 Suicide risk is significantly higher among individuals diagnosed with single episode 
depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder than among the general population.
•	 Recurrent panic attacks in single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive 
disorder may be indicative of greater severity, poorer response to treatment, and greater 
risk of suicide.
•	 The presence of dementia or a disorder of intellectual development does not rule out 
the diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, but 
communication difficulties may make it necessary to rely more than usual on observations 
made by clinicians or knowledgeable collateral informants to make the diagnosis. 
Observable symptoms include psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and weight, and 
sleep disturbance.
•	 There is a greater risk of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder 
among individuals with a family history of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent 
depressive disorder.

Mood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder

Mood disorders
•	 Co-occurrence with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders is 
common, including anxiety and fear-related disorders, bodily distress disorder, obsessive-
compulsive and related disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, disorders due to substance 
use, eating disorders and personality disorder.
Course features for single episode depressive disorder and recurrent 
depressive disorder
•	 The prevalence of depressive disorders significantly increases at puberty, with the average 
age of onset occurring during the mid-20s.
•	 In the absence of intervention, depressive episodes typically last 3–4 months, with nearly 
half of affected individuals experiencing symptom reduction within 3 months and the 
majority experiencing remission within 1 year. Remission and recurrence rates vary widely; 
most individuals experience an average of four depressive episodes over their lifetime, and 
approximately half experience a recurrence within the first 5 years. The risk of relapse 
increases with each subsequent depressive episode.
•	 It is common for depressive symptoms to persist between discrete episodes (i.e. partial 
remission), with some individuals never experiencing a complete remission of symptoms. 
This presentation warrants closer attention, because symptom persistence has been 
associated with shorter time to relapse as well as co-occurrence of other mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders including personality disorder, anxiety and fear-related 
disorders, and disorders due to substance use.
•	 Lower rates of recovery are associated with longer duration and severity of symptoms and 
the presence of psychotic features.
•	 Individuals with bipolar disorders often present initially with a depressive episode. 
Vulnerability factors associated with transition from a depressive disorder to a bipolar 
disorder include earlier age at onset, a family history of bipolar disorders and the presence 
of psychotic symptoms.
Culture-related features for single episode depressive disorder and 
recurrent depressive disorder
•	 The cultural salience of depressive symptoms may vary across social groups as a result of 
varying cultural “scripts” for the disorder, which make specific types of symptoms more 
prominent. For example, psychological (e.g. sadness, emotional numbness, rumination), 
moral (e.g. guilt, worthlessness), social/interpersonal (e.g. lack of productivity, conflictive 
relationships), hedonic (e.g. decreased pleasure), spiritual (e.g. dreams of dead relatives) or 
somatic (e.g. insomnia, pain, fatigue, dizziness) symptoms may systematically predominate 
among specific cultural or social groups.
•	 In some cultural contexts, mood changes are more readily expressed in the form of bodily 
symptoms (e.g. pain, fatigue, weakness) rather than directly reported as psychological 
symptoms.
•	 The perceived abnormality or acceptability of depressive symptoms may vary across 
cultures, affecting symptom detection and treatment acceptability. For example, some 
social groups or age cohorts may consider depressive symptoms to be normal reactions to 
adversity, depending on their tolerance of negative emotions or social withdrawal.
Mood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Some types of symptoms may be considered more shameful or severe according to cultural 
norms, leading to reporting biases. For example, some cultural groups may emphasize 
shame more than guilt, whereas in others suicidal behaviour and thinking may be 
prohibited or highly stigmatized. In some cultural groups, features such as sadness and 
lack of productivity may be perceived as signs of personal weakness and therefore be 
underreported.
•	 Symptoms attributed to cultural concepts of distress may be evoked when asking about 
depressive symptomatology. Among Chinese people, for example, symptoms of shenjing 
shuairuo, or weakness of the nervous system (e.g. weakness, headache, bodily aches, fatigue, 
feeling vexed, loss of face) may be commonly reported. Culturally related symptoms and 
idioms of distress may complicate detection of depressive disorders and assessment of 
severity, including whether psychotic symptoms are present. Examples include pain in 
heart, soul loss, aching heart, complaints related to “nerves” and heat inside the body. In 
some cultures, a focus on a particular observable behaviour (e.g. “thinking too much”) 
may be what is reported.
Sex- and/or gender-related features for single episode depressive 
disorder and recurrent depressive disorder
•	 Lifetime prevalence of depressive disorders is approximately twice as high among women. 
Gender differences in prevalence coincide with onset of puberty.
•	 Although women are more likely to attempt suicide, men are more likely to die by suicide 
by virtue of using more lethal methods.
•	 Women with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder are more likely to experience co-occurring 
anxiety and fear-related disorders, disturbances in appetite and weight gain, whereas it is 
more common for men to experience co-occurring alcohol and other disorders due to 
substance use, poor impulse control and increased risk-taking behaviour.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential 
diagnosis) for single episode depressive disorder and recurrent 
depressive disorder
Boundary with dysthymic disorder
Single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive disorder are differentiated from 
dysthymic disorder by the number of symptoms and the course of the disorder. Dysthymic 
disorder is a chronic and persistent condition, and during the initial period of 2 years necessary 
to establish the diagnosis, the number and duration of symptoms are not sufficient to meet 
the diagnostic requirements for a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent 
depressive disorder. After this initial period, if the number and severity of symptoms reaches the 
diagnostic threshold for a depressive episode in the context of an ongoing dysthymic disorder, 
both dysthymic disorder and either single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive 
disorder may be diagnosed. Unlike dysthymic disorder, recurrent depressive disorder is episodic 
in nature. However, long periods of subthreshold depressive symptoms that occur following 
depressive episodes when there has not been an initial 2-year period of subthreshold symptoms 
are better diagnosed as single episode depressive disorder in partial remission or recurrent 
depressive disorder in partial remission.
Mood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder

Mood disorders
Boundary with mixed depressive and anxiety disorder
Individuals who present with both depressive and anxiety symptoms more days than not for 
a period of 2 weeks or more, with neither set of symptoms – considered separately – being 
sufficiently severe, numerous or lasting to justify a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder 
or recurrent depressive disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder may be diagnosed with 
mixed depressive and anxiety disorder.
Boundary with cyclothymic disorder
Although, in general, depressive periods in cyclothymic disorder are not sufficient to meet the 
diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, there may be instances in which the symptoms 
are severe enough to constitute a depressive episode. In such cases, if there is no history of 
hypomanic episodes, single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder may be 
diagnosed, as appropriate, along with cyclothymic disorder.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can exhibit 
psychotic symptoms, but these occur only during depressive episodes. Conversely, individuals 
with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may experience 
significant depressive symptoms during psychotic episodes. In such cases, if the depressive 
symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, the depressive 
mood symptoms specifier may be applied to the psychotic disorder diagnosis. If all diagnostic 
requirements for both a depressive episode and schizophrenia are met concurrently or within a 
few days of each other, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder should be assigned rather than 
single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder. However, a diagnosis of 
single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder can co-occur with a diagnosis 
of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if 
the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, and psychotic symptoms are present outside of 
depressive episodes.
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder and depressive episodes in single episode depressive disorder or 
recurrent depressive disorder can share several features, such as somatic symptoms of anxiety, 
difficulty with concentration, sleep disruption and feelings of dread associated with pessimistic 
thoughts. Single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder are differentiated 
by the presence of low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and other 
characteristic symptoms of a depressive episode (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, 
recurrent thoughts of death). In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals are focused on potential 
negative outcomes that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, 
work) rather than thoughts of worthlessness or hopelessness. Rumination often occurs in the 
context of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder but, unlike in 
generalized anxiety disorder, is not usually accompanied by persistent worry and apprehension 
about various everyday aspects of life. Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with single 
episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, but should only be diagnosed if 
the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to the onset of or 
following complete remission of a depressive episode.
Boundary with other anxiety and fear-related disorders
Symptoms of anxiety, including panic attacks, are common in single episode depressive disorder 
and recurrent depressive disorder, and in some individuals may be a prominent aspect of the 
clinical presentation. In such cases, the with prominent anxiety symptoms specifier should be 
applied to the diagnosis for non-panic anxiety symptoms. If the anxiety symptoms meet the 
diagnostic requirements for an anxiety or fear-related disorder, the appropriate diagnosis from 
the anxiety and fear-related disorders grouping should also be assigned. For panic attacks, if these 
Mood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

occur entirely in the context of anxiety associated with depressive episodes in single episode 
depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, they are appropriately designated using the 
with panic attacks specifier. However, if panic attacks also occur outside of symptomatic mood 
episodes and other diagnostic requirements are met, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder should 
be considered. Both specifiers may be assigned if warranted.
Boundary with adjustment disorder
Adjustment disorder is characterized by a maladaptive reaction to identifiable psychosocial 
stressors, and can include depressive symptoms (e.g. rumination), but does not include a 
sufficient number and severity of symptoms to meet the requirements for a depressive episode. If 
the adjustment reaction meets the diagnostic requirements for single episode depressive disorder 
or recurrent depressive disorder, even in the presence of identifiable psychosocial stressors, single 
episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder should be diagnosed rather than 
adjustment disorder.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
It is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance and 
symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of a mood disorder. Specifically, noncompliance may 
result from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in activities, 
difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). Oppositional 
defiant disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, and irritability/anger can be a common 
symptom across these disorders. When the behaviour problems occur primarily in the context of 
a depressive episode, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned. 
However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, 
and the behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant disorder are observed outside 
the occurrence of depressive episodes.
Boundary with insomnia
Individuals experiencing insomnia may also report depressed mood and may develop other 
depressive symptoms. However, the breadth and severity of symptoms are generally not 
sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements for single episode depressive disorder or recurrent 
depressive disorder.
Boundary with secondary mood syndrome
A depressive syndrome that is a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism) 
should be diagnosed as secondary mood syndrome rather than single episode depressive disorder 
or recurrent depressive disorder.
Boundary with substance-induced mood disorder
A depressive syndrome due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants), should be 
diagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder rather than single episode depressive disorder or 
recurrent depressive disorder. The presence of continuing mood disturbance should be assessed 
once the physiological effects of the relevant substance subside.
Mood disorders | Recurrent depressive disorder

Mood disorders
Dysthymic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent depressed mood (i.e. lasting 2 years or more), for most of the day, for more days 
than not, as reported by the individual (e.g. feeling down, sad) or as observed (e.g. tearful, 
defeated appearance), is required for diagnosis. In children and adolescents depressed 
mood can manifest as pervasive irritability.
•	 The depressed mood is accompanied by additional symptoms typically seen in a depressive 
episode, though these may be milder in form. Examples include:
•	 markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities
•	 reduced concentration and attention, or indecisiveness
•	 low self-worth, or excessive or inappropriate guilt
•	 hopelessness about the future
•	 disturbed sleep or increased sleep
•	 diminished or increased appetite
•	 low energy or fatigue.
•	 During the first 2 years of the disorder, there has never been a 2-week period during which 
the number and duration of symptoms were sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements 
for a depressive episode.
•	 While brief symptom-free intervals during the period of persistent depressed mood are 
consistent with the diagnosis, there have never been any prolonged symptom-free periods 
(e.g. lasting 2 months or more) since the onset of the disorder.
•	 There is no history of manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes, which would indicate the 
presence of a bipolar or related disorder.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent depressive 
symptoms or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational 
or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through 
significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 In children, it may be appropriate to assign the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder after a 
briefer period of initial symptoms (e.g. 1 year).
•	 Suicide risk is significantly higher among individuals diagnosed with dysthymic disorder 
than among the general population.
Mood disorders | Dysthymic disorder
6A72

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 There is a greater risk of dysthymic disorder among individuals with a family history of 
mood disorders.
•	 Co-occurrence with other mental disorders is common, including anxiety and fear-
related disorders, bodily distress disorder, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, 
oppositional defiant disorder, disorders due to substance use, feeding and eating disorders, 
and personality disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Some depressed mood is a normal reaction to severe adverse life events and problems, and 
is common in the community. Dysthymic disorder is differentiated from this common 
experience by the severity, range and duration of symptoms. Assessment of the presence 
or absence of signs or symptoms should be made relative to typical functioning of 
the individual.
Course features
•	 Dysthymic disorder typically has a gradual onset beginning in childhood, adolescence or 
early adulthood.
•	 The course of dysthymic disorder may fluctuate between dysthymia and symptoms of 
single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder.
•	 Early onset of dysthymic disorder is associated with increased likelihood of co-occurring 
anxiety and fear-related disorders, personality disorder and substance use disorders.
•	 In contrast to high rates of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders in young adults, dysthymic disorder in older adults typically occurs without co-
occurrence.
•	 Greater symptom severity, higher levels of negative affectivity, poorer global functioning 
and the presence of an anxiety or fear-related disorder or conduct-dissocial disorder have 
been associated with poorer long-term outcomes.
Developmental presentations
•	 In young children, dysthymic disorder may present as somatic complaints (e.g. headaches, 
stomach pains), whining, increased anxiety or fearfulness, or excessive crying.
•	 Adolescents with dysthymic disorder may demonstrate low self-esteem, and may be more 
reactive to negative (or perceived negative) feedback from others.
•	 Children and adolescents may present with pervasive irritability rather than depressed 
mood. However, the presence of irritability is not in and of itself indicative of 
dysthymic disorder, and may indicate the presence of another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder or be a normal reaction to frustration.
Mood disorders | Dysthymic disorder

Mood disorders
•	 In children and adolescents, reduced ability to concentrate or sustain attention may 
manifest as a decline in academic performance, increased time needed to complete school 
assignments, or an inability to complete assignments.
Culture-related features
•	 Little information is available about cultural influences on dysthymic disorder. The 
information on culture-related features for single episode depressive disorder and recurrent 
depressive disorder (p. 251) may be relevant.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although dysthymic disorder is more common among women during early and middle 
adulthood, there are no notable gender differences among older adults with late-onset 
dysthymic disorder.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with single episode depressive disorder and recurrent depressive 
disorder
Dysthymic disorder is differentiated from single episode depressive disorder and recurrent 
depressive disorder by the number of symptoms and the course of the disorder. Dysthymic 
disorder is a chronic and persistent condition, and during the initial period of 2 years necessary 
to establish the diagnosis, the number and duration of symptoms are not sufficient to meet 
the diagnostic requirements for a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder or recurrent 
depressive disorder. After this initial period, if the number and severity of symptoms reaches the 
diagnostic threshold for a depressive episode in the context of an ongoing dysthymic disorder, 
both dysthymic disorder and either single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive 
disorder may be diagnosed. Unlike dysthymic disorder, recurrent depressive disorder is episodic 
in nature. However, long periods of subthreshold depressive symptoms that occur following 
depressive episodes when there has not been an initial 2-year period of subthreshold symptoms 
are better diagnosed as single episode depressive disorder in partial remission or recurrent 
depressive disorder in partial remission.
Boundary with bipolar and related disorders
Individuals with a pattern of depressive symptoms that resembles dysthymic disorder who have a 
history of manic or mixed episodes should be diagnosed with bipolar type I disorder. A pattern of 
chronic mood instability that is characterized by periods of both depressive symptomatology, and 
that is not sufficiently severe or prolonged to meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive 
episode and periods of hypomanic symptomatology should be diagnosed as cyclothymic disorder.
Mood disorders | Dysthymic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Depressive symptoms are common in schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and other primary 
psychotic disorders, and these should only be diagnosed as dysthymic disorder if they persist for 
several years after the full remission of psychotic symptoms.
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymic disorder can share several features, such as somatic 
symptoms of anxiety, difficulty with concentration, sleep disruption and feelings of dread 
associated with pessimistic thoughts. Dysthymic disorder is differentiated by the presence of low 
mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities and other characteristic symptoms 
of dysthymic disorder (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, recurrent thoughts of 
death). In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals are focused on potential negative outcomes 
that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, work) rather than 
thoughts of worthlessness or hopelessness. Rumination often occurs in the context of dysthymic 
disorder but, unlike in generalized anxiety disorder, is not usually accompanied by persistent 
worry and apprehension about various everyday aspects of life. Generalized anxiety disorder may 
co-occur with dysthymic disorder, but should only be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements 
for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to the onset of dysthymic disorder.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
It is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance and 
symptoms of irritability/anger to arise as part of mood disturbance. Specifically, noncompliance 
may result from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in 
activities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). 
When the behaviour problems occur primarily in the context of mood disturbance, a separate 
diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with secondary mood syndrome
A chronic depressive syndrome that is a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. 
hypothyroidism) should be diagnosed as secondary mood syndrome rather than dysthymic 
disorder.
Boundary with substance-induced mood disorder
A chronic depressive syndrome due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system (e.g. benzodiazepines) – including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants) – 
should be diagnosed as substance-induced mood disorder rather than dysthymic disorder.
Mixed depressive and anxiety disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of both depressive and anxiety symptoms for most of the time during a 
period of 2 weeks or more is required for diagnosis.
6A73
Mood disorders | Mixed depressive and anxiety disorder

Mood disorders
•	 Depressive symptoms include depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or 
pleasure in activities.
•	 There are multiple anxiety symptoms, which may include feeling nervous, anxious or on 
edge, not being able to control worrying thoughts, fear that something awful will happen, 
having trouble relaxing, muscle tension or sympathetic autonomic symptoms.
•	 Neither the depressive nor the anxiety symptoms – considered separately – are sufficiently 
severe, numerous or lasting to meet the diagnostic requirements of another depressive 
disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder. There is no history of manic or mixed 
episodes, which would indicate the presence of a bipolar disorder.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g. from alcohol, benzodiazepines).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Individuals with this mixture of comparatively mild symptoms of depression and anxiety 
are frequently seen in primary care, but many more cases exist among the population at 
large, which never come to clinical attention.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 If worry is the only anxiety symptom (i.e. no sympathetic autonomic or other anxiety 
symptoms are present), a diagnosis of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder diagnosis is 
not appropriate.
Course features
•	 Epidemiological studies have yielded varying results regarding the course and onset of 
mixed depressive and anxiety disorder.
•	 While there is some evidence to suggest that approximately half of individuals with mixed 
depressive and anxiety disorder will experience remission of symptoms within 1 year of 
onset, those who do not remit are at increased risk of developing a mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder that meets the full diagnostic requirements – typically for 
a depressive disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder.
Mood disorders | Mixed depressive and anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Little information is available about cultural influences on mixed depressive and anxiety 
disorder. The information on culture-related features for single episode depressive disorder 
and recurrent depressive disorder (p. 251) and for generalized anxiety disorder (p. 258) 
may be relevant.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with other depressive disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders
If the depressive symptoms or anxiety symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for a 
depressive episode or an anxiety or fear-related disorder, then the depressive or anxiety or 
fear-related disorder should be diagnosed rather than mixed depressive and anxiety disorder. 
If appropriate, the with prominent anxiety symptoms specifier may be applied to single episode 
depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder diagnoses.
Boundary with bipolar and related disorders
Mixed depressive and anxiety disorder should not be diagnosed if there is a history of manic or 
mixed episodes, which would indicate the presence of a bipolar disorder.
Boundary with adjustment disorder
If the onset of the symptoms occurs in close association with significant life changes or stressful 
life events, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is generally more appropriate than mixed depressive 
and anxiety disorder.
Other specified depressive disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by depressive symptoms that share primary clinical 
features with other depressive disorders (e.g. depressed mood, decreased engagement in 
pleasurable activities, decreased energy levels, disruptions in sleep or eating).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
depressive disorders grouping.
6A7Y
Mood disorders | Other specified depressive disorder

Mood disorders
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, 
an anxiety or fear-related disorder, a disorder specifically associated with stress).
•	 The symptoms and behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepine) on the 
central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g. from cocaine).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Depressive disorder, unspecified
Secondary-parented category in depressive disorders
The following category is classified in Chapter 16 on diseases of the genitourinary system, but 
is cross-listed (secondary-parented) here because of the prominence of mood symptoms in its 
clinical presentation, and to assist in differential diagnosis.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 During a majority of menstrual cycles within the past year, a pattern of mood, somatic or 
cognitive symptoms is present that begins several days before the onset of menses, starts to 
improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and then becomes minimal or absent 
within approximately 1 week following the onset of menses. The temporal relationship of 
the symptoms and luteal and menstrual phases of the cycle should ideally be confirmed by 
a prospective symptom diary over at least two symptomatic menstrual cycles.
•	 The symptoms include:
•	 at least one affective symptom such as mood lability, irritability, depressed mood or 
anxiety;
•	 additional somatic or cognitive symptoms such as lethargy, joint pain, overeating, 
hypersomnia, breast tenderness, swelling of extremities, concentration difficulties or 
forgetfulness.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a mood 
disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder).

polycystic ovary disease, adrenal system disorders or hyperprolactinemia), and are not due 
to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. hormone 
treatment, alcohol), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Mild mood changes (e.g. increased emotional lability, irritability, subjective tension) 
that occur during late luteal or menstrual phase of the cycle for many women should not 
be labelled as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In contrast to premenstrual dysphoric 
disorder, these symptoms are less intense and do not typically result in significant distress 
or impairment.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with premenstrual tension syndrome
Many women may experience cyclic emotional, physical or behavioural symptoms that interfere 
with their lifestyles during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle that are appropriately 
diagnosed and treated as premenstrual tension syndrome. This is in contrast to premenstrual 
dysphoric disorder, in which the symptoms are considerably more severe and cause significant 
distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning.
Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, 
including mood disorders that are exacerbated premenstrually
Mood symptoms characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder – including depressed mood, 
irritability and anxiety – can be present in other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, generalized anxiety disorder). Although 
symptoms of these disorders may be exacerbated during the late luteal and menstrual phases, 
premenstrual dysphoric disorder is differentiated by the absence of symptoms 1 week following 
the onset of menses. Because of the difficulty in accurate recall of the relationship between 
menstrual cycle and the course of symptoms, prospective mood ratings for two consecutive cycles 
should be considered.
Boundary with dysmenorrhoea
Dysmenorrhoea is characterized by cyclic pelvic pain or lower, umbilical or suprapubic 
abdominal pain preceding or accompanying menstruation that interferes with daily activities. 
Unlike premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the onset of dysmenorrhoea is coincident with the start 
of rather than prior to menses. Furthermore, mood symptoms are not typically associated with 
this condition.
Mood disorders | Depressive disorder, unspecified

Mood disorders
Boundary with the effects of hormones and their synthetic substitutes and 
antagonists
Use of hormone treatments, including for contraceptive purposes, may result in unwanted side-
effects that include mood, somatic and cognitive symptoms. If symptoms do not persist after 
cessation of these medications beyond the period when their physiological effects should have 
subsided, a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned.
Other specified mood disorder
Essential (required) features
The presentation is characterized by mood symptoms that cannot clearly be described as bipolar 
or depressive in nature (e.g. marked and persistent irritability in the absence of other clear manic 
or depressive symptoms).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the mood 
disorders grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by anothewr mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, an 
anxiety or fear-related disorder, a disorder specifically associated with stress, oppositional 
defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger, personality disorder).
•	 The symptoms and behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepine) on the 
central nervous system, including withdrawal effects (e.g. from cocaine).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.

Anxiety or fear-related disorder, unspecified.
Panic disorder
Anxiety and fear-related disorders are characterized by excessive fear and anxiety, and related 
behavioural disturbances, with symptoms severe enough to result in significant distress or 
impairment in functioning. Fear and anxiety are closely related phenomena: fear represents a 
reaction to perceived imminent threat in the present, whereas anxiety is more future-oriented, 
referring to perceived anticipated threat. One of the major ways in which different anxiety and 
fear-related disorders are distinguished from one another is the focus of apprehension – that is, 
the stimuli or situations that trigger the fear or anxiety. The focus of apprehension may be highly 
specific, as in specific phobia, or relate to a broader class of situations, as in generalized anxiety 
disorder. The clinical presentation of anxiety and fear-related disorders typically includes specific 
associated cognitions that can assist in differentiating among the disorders by clarifying the focus 
of apprehension.

General cultural considerations for anxiety and fear-related disorders
•	 For many cultural groups, somatic complaints rather than cognitive symptoms may 
predominate in the clinical presentation.
•	 In some cultural contexts, symptoms of fear and anxiety may be described primarily in 
terms of external forces or factors (e.g. witchcraft, sorcery, malign magic or envy), and not 
as an internal experience or psychological state.
Generalized anxiety disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Marked symptoms of anxiety are required for diagnosis, manifested in either:
•	 general apprehensiveness that is not restricted to any particular environmental 
circumstance (i.e. “free-floating anxiety”); or
•	 excessive worry (apprehensive expectation) about negative events occurring in several 
different aspects of everyday life (e.g. work, finances, health, family).
•	 Anxiety and general apprehensiveness or worry are accompanied by additional 
characteristic symptoms, such as:
•	 muscle tension or motor restlessness;
•	 sympathetic autonomic overactivity as evidenced by frequent gastrointestinal symptoms 
such as nausea and/or abdominal distress, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shaking 
and/or dry mouth;
•	 subjective experience of nervousness, restlessness or being “on edge”;
•	 difficulty concentrating;
•	 irritability;
•	 sleep disturbances (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).
•	 The symptoms are not transient and persist for at least several months, for more days 
than not.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a depressive 
disorder).
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. hyperthyroidism), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. caffeine, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepines).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant 
additional effort.
6B00
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Some individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may only report general 
apprehensiveness accompanied by chronic somatic symptoms without being able to 
articulate specific worry content.
•	 Behavioural changes such as avoidance, frequent need for reassurance (especially in 
children) and procrastination may be seen. These behaviours typically represent an effort 
to reduce apprehension or prevent untoward events from occurring.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Anxiety and worry are normal emotional/cognitive states that commonly occur when 
people are under stress. At optimal levels, anxiety and worry may help to direct problem-
solving efforts, focus attention adaptively and increase alertness. Normal anxiety and worry 
are usually sufficiently self-regulated that they do not interfere with functioning or cause 
marked distress. In generalized anxiety disorder, the anxiety or worry is excessive, persistent 
and intense, and may have a significant negative impact on functioning. Individuals under 
extremely stressful circumstances (e.g. living in a war zone) may experience intense and 
impairing anxiety and worry that is appropriate to their environmental circumstances. 
These experiences should not be regarded as symptomatic of generalized anxiety disorder 
if they occur only under such circumstances.
Course features
•	 Onset of generalized anxiety disorder may occur at any age. However, the typical age of 
onset is during the early to mid-30s.
•	 Earlier onset of symptoms is associated with greater impairment of functioning and 
presence of co-occurring mental disorders.
•	 Severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms often fluctuates between threshold and 
subthreshold forms of the disorder, and full remission of symptoms is uncommon.
•	 Although the clinical features of generalized anxiety disorder generally remain consistent 
across the lifespan, the content of the individual’s worry may vary over time, and there are 
differences in worry content among different age groups. Children and adolescents tend to 
worry about the quality of academic and sports-related performance, whereas adults tend 
to worry more about their own well-being or that of their loved ones.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Developmental presentations
•	 Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhood 
and adolescence. Among these disorders, generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most 
common in late childhood and adolescence.
•	 Occurrence of generalized anxiety disorder increases across late childhood and adolescence 
with development of cognitive abilities that support the capacity for worry, which is a core 
feature of the disorder. As a result of their less developed cognitive abilities, generalized 
anxiety disorder is uncommon in children younger than 5 years.
•	 While the essential features of generalized anxiety disorder still apply to children and 
adolescents, specific manifestations of worry in children may include being overly 
concerned and compliant with rules, as well as a strong desire to please others. Affected 
children may become upset when they perceive peers as acting out or being disobedient. 
Consequently, children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may be more 
likely to report excessively on their peers’ misbehaviour or to act as an authority figure 
around peers, condemning misbehaviour. This may have a negative effect on affected 
individuals’ interpersonal relationships.
•	 Children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may engage in excessive 
reassurance-seeking from others, asking questions repeatedly, and may exhibit distress 
when faced with uncertainty. They may be overly perfectionistic, taking additional time 
to complete tasks such as homework or classwork. Sensitivity to perceived criticism is 
common.
•	 When generalized anxiety disorder does occur in children, somatic symptoms – particularly 
those related to sympathetic autonomic overactivity – may be prominent aspects of the 
clinical presentation. Common somatic symptoms in children with generalized anxiety 
disorder include frequent headaches, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal distress. As with 
adults, children and adolescents also experience sleep disturbances, including delayed 
sleep onset and night-time wakefulness.
•	 The number and content of worries typically manifests differently across childhood and 
adolescence. Younger children are more like to have more concerns about their safety, their 
health or the health of others. Adolescents typically report a greater number of worries, 
with content shifting to performance, perfectionism and whether they will be able to meet 
the expectations of others.
•	 Adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder may demonstrate excessive irritability and 
have an increased risk of co-occurring depressive symptoms.
Culture-related features
•	 For many cultural groups, somatic complaints rather than excessive worry may predominate 
in the clinical presentation. These symptoms may involve a range of physical complaints 
not typically associated with generalized anxiety disorder, such as dizziness and heat in 
the head.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
•	 Realistic worries may be misjudged as excessive without appropriate contextual 
information. For example, migrant workers may worry greatly about being deported, but 
this may be related to actual deportation threats by their employer. On the other hand, 
evidence of worries across several different aspects of everyday life may be difficult to 
establish when an individual places emphasis on a single overwhelming source of worry 
(e.g. financial concerns).
•	 Worry content may vary by cultural group, related to topics that are salient in the milieu. 
For example, in societies where relationships with deceased relatives are important, worry 
may focus on their spiritual status in the afterlife. Worry in more individualistic cultures 
may emphasize personal achievement, fulfilment of expectations or self-confidence.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is approximately twice as high among 
women.
•	 Among individuals with onset of generalized anxiety disorder during childhood or 
adolescence, girls are likely to have earlier symptom onset.
•	 Although symptom presentation does not vary by gender – including the common co-
occurrence of generalized anxiety disorder and depressive disorders – men are more likely 
to experience co-occurring disorders due to substance use.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions 
(differential diagnosis)
Boundary with panic disorder
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited episodes of intense fear or 
anxiety. Generalized anxiety disorder is differentiated by a more persistent and less circumscribed 
chronic feeling of apprehensiveness, usually associated with worry about a variety of different 
everyday life events. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may experience panic 
attacks that are triggered by specific worries. If an individual with generalized anxiety disorder 
experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of the worry about a variety of everyday 
life events, or general apprehensiveness without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, an 
additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted and the presence of panic attacks may be 
indicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, 
an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
In social anxiety disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g. speaking 
in public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negatively 
evaluated by others. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry about the 
implications of performing poorly or failing an examination but are not exclusively concerned 
about being negatively evaluated by others.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

associated with pessimistic thoughts. Depressive disorders are differentiated by the presence 
of low mood or loss of pleasure in previously enjoyable activities, and by other characteristic 
symptoms of depressive disorders (e.g. appetite changes, feelings of worthlessness, suicidal 
ideation). Generalized anxiety disorder may co-occur with depressive disorders, but should only 
be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements for generalized anxiety disorder were met prior to 
the onset of or following complete remission of a depressive episode.
Boundary with adjustment disorder
Adjustment disorder involves maladaptive reactions to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or 
multiple stressors characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences. Reactions 
may include excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant 
rumination about its implications. Adjustment disorder centres on the identifiable stressor or 
its consequences, whereas in generalized anxiety disorder, worry typically encompasses multiple 
areas of daily life and may include hypothetical concerns (e.g. that a negative life event may occur). 
Unlike individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, those with adjustment disorder typically 
have normal functioning prior to the onset of the stressors. Symptoms of adjustment disorder 
generally resolve within 6 months.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the focus of apprehension is on intrusive and unwanted 
thoughts, urges or images (obsessions), whereas in generalized anxiety disorder the focus is 
on everyday life events. In contrast to obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, which are 
usually experienced as unwanted and intrusive, individuals with generalized anxiety disorder 
may experience their worry as a helpful strategy in averting negative outcomes.
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder) and bodily distress 
disorder
In hypochondriasis and bodily distress disorder, individuals worry about real or perceived physical 
symptoms and their potential significance to their health status. Individuals with generalized 
anxiety disorder experience somatic symptoms associated with anxiety and may worry about 
their health, but their worry extends to other aspects of everyday life.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder
Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder develop hypervigilance as a consequence of 
exposure to the traumatic stressor, and may become apprehensive that they or others close to 
them may be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more generally. Individuals 
with post-traumatic stress disorder may also experience anxiety triggered by reminders of the 
traumatic event (e.g. fear and avoidance of a place where an individual was assaulted). In contrast, 
the anxiety and worry in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder is directed towards the 
possibility of untoward events in a variety of life domains (e.g. health, finances, work).
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Generalized anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Panic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Recurrent panic attacks, which are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension 
characterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms, are 
required for diagnosis. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	 palpitations or increased heart rate
•	 sweating
•	 trembling
•	 sensations of shortness of breath
•	 feelings of choking
•	 chest pain
•	 nausea or abdominal distress
•	 feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness
•	 chills or hot flushes
•	 tingling or lack of sensation in extremities (i.e. paraesthesias)
•	 depersonalization or derealization
•	 fear of losing control or going mad
•	 fear of imminent death.
•	 At least some of the panic attacks are unexpected – that is, they are not restricted to 
particular stimuli or situations but rather seem to arise “out of the blue”.
•	 Panic attacks are followed by persistent concern or worry (e.g. for several weeks) about 
their recurrence or their perceived negative significance (e.g. that the physiological 
symptoms may be those of a myocardial infarction), or by behaviours intended to avoid 
their recurrence (e.g. only leaving the home with a trusted companion).
•	 Panic attacks are not limited to anxiety-provoking situations in the context of another 
mental disorder.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. 
pheochromocytoma), and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on 
the central nervous system (e.g. coffee, cocaine), including withdrawal effects (e.g. alcohol, 
benzodiazepines).
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
Note: panic attacks can occur in other anxiety and fear-related disorders and in other mental 
disorders; therefore, the presence of panic attacks is not in itself sufficient to assign a diagnosis of 
panic disorder.
6B01
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Individual panic attacks usually only last for minutes, though some may last longer. The 
frequency and severity of panic attacks varies widely (e.g. many times per day to a few 
times per month) within and across individuals.
•	 In panic disorder, it is common for panic attacks to become more “expected” over time 
as they become associated with particular stimuli or contexts, which may originally have 
been coincidental. (For example, an individual who has an unexpected panic attack when 
crossing a bridge may subsequently become anxious when crossing bridges, which could 
then lead to “expected” panic attacks in response to bridges.)
•	 Limited-symptom attacks (i.e. attacks that are similar to panic attacks, except that they 
are accompanied by only a few symptoms characteristic of a panic attack without the 
characteristic intense peak of symptoms) are common in individuals with panic disorder, 
particularly as behavioural strategies (e.g. avoidance) are used to curtail anxiety symptoms. 
However, in order to qualify for a diagnosis of panic disorder, there must be a history of 
recurrent panic attacks that meet the full diagnostic requirements.
•	 Some individuals with panic disorder experience nocturnal panic attacks – that is, waking 
from sleep in a state of panic.
•	 Although the pattern of symptoms (e.g. mainly respiratory, nocturnal), the severity of the 
anxiety and the extent of avoidance behaviours are variable, panic disorder is one of the 
most impairing of the anxiety disorders. Individuals often present repeatedly for emergency 
care, and may undergo a range of unnecessary and costly special medical investigations 
despite repeated negative findings.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Panic attacks are common in the general population, particularly in response to anxiety-
provoking life events. Panic attacks in response to real threats to an individual’s physical or 
psychological integrity are considered part of the normative continuum of reactions, and a 
diagnosis is not warranted in such cases. Panic disorder is differentiated from normal fear 
reactions by frequent recurrence of panic attacks, persistent worry or concern about the 
panic attacks or their meaning, or alterations in behaviour (e.g. avoidance) and associated 
significant impairment in functioning.
•	 The sudden onset, rapid peaking, unexpected nature and intense severity of panic attacks 
differentiate them from normal situationally bound anxiety that may be experienced in 
everyday life (e.g. during stressful life transitions such as moving to a new city).
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Course features
•	 Onset of panic disorder typically occurs during the early 20s.
•	 Some individuals experience episodic symptom outbreaks with long periods of remission, 
while others experience persistent, severe symptoms.
•	 The presence of co-occurring disorders (e.g. other anxiety and fear-related disorders, 
depressive disorders, disorders due to substance use) has been associated with poorer 
long-term course trajectory.
•	 A co-occurring diagnosis of agoraphobia is generally associated with greater symptom 
severity and a poorer long-term prognosis.
Developmental presentations
•	 Although some children report physical symptoms of panic attacks, panic disorder is 
very rare in younger children because cognitive capacity for catastrophizing about the 
significance of symptoms is not yet fully developed. The prevalence of panic disorder 
increases across adolescence and early adulthood.
•	 Adolescents with panic disorder are at greater risk of a co-occurring depressive disorder 
including suicidality, as well as of disorders due to substance use.
Culture-related features
•	 The symptom presentation of panic attacks may vary across cultures, influenced by cultural 
attributions about their etiology. For example, individuals of Cambodian origin may 
emphasize panic symptoms attributed to dysregulation of khyâl, a wind-like substance in 
traditional Cambodian ethnophysiology (e.g. dizziness, tinnitus, neck soreness).
•	 Several notable cultural concepts of distress are related to panic disorder; these link panic, 
fear or anxiety to etiological attributions regarding specific social and environmental 
influences. Examples include attributions related to interpersonal conflict (e.g. ataque 
de nervios among Latin American people), exertion or orthostasis (khyâl cap among 
Cambodians), and atmospheric wind (trúng gió among Vietnamese individuals). These 
cultural labels may be applied to symptom presentations other than panic (e.g. anger 
paroxysms, in the case of ataque de nervios), but they often constitute panic episodes or 
presentations with partial phenomenological overlap with panic attacks.
•	 Clarifying cultural attributions and the context of the experience of symptoms can inform 
whether panic attacks should be considered unexpected, as must be the case in panic 
disorder. For example, panic attacks may involve specific foci of apprehension that are 
better accounted for by another disorder (e.g. social situations in social anxiety disorder). 
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Moreover, the cultural linkage of the apprehension focus with specific exposures (e.g. wind 
or cold and trúng gió panic attacks) may suggest that acute anxiety is expected when 
considered within the individual’s cultural framework.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Panic disorder is twice as prevalent among females as males, with gender differences in 
prevalence rates beginning during puberty.
•	 Gender differences in clinical features or symptom presentation have not been observed.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Some individuals with panic disorder may experience anxiety and worry between panic attacks. 
If the focus of the anxiety and worry is confined to fear of having a panic attack or the possible 
implications of panic attacks (e.g. that the individual may be suffering from a cardiovascular 
illness), an additional diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder is not warranted. If, however, the 
individual is more generally anxious about a number of life events in addition to experiencing 
unexpected panic attacks, an additional diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder may be 
appropriate.
Boundary with agoraphobia
During the early phase of panic disorder, panic attacks are often perceived as completely 
unpredictable or “out of the blue”. However, over time, as panic attacks occur in specific situations, 
those situations become associated with the experience of intense anxiety. As a consequence, the 
individual may develop anticipatory anxiety about being in those situations, or exposure to those 
situations may actually trigger panic attacks. In this way, it is common for individuals with panic 
disorder to develop some degree of agoraphobic symptoms over time. If the individual develops 
fears that panic attacks or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms will occur in multiple 
situations, and as a result actively avoids these situations, requires the presence of a companion, 
or endures them only with intense fear or anxiety and all other diagnostic requirements for 
agoraphobia are met, an additional diagnosis of agoraphobia may be assigned.
Boundary with depressive disorders
Panic attacks can occur in depressive disorders – particularly in those with prominent anxiety 
symptoms, including mixed depressive and anxiety disorder – and may be triggered by depressive 
ruminations. If unexpected panic attacks occur in the context of these disorders and the main 
concern is about recurrence of panic attacks or the significance of panic symptoms, an additional 
diagnosis of panic disorder may be appropriate.
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
Individuals with hypochondriasis often misinterpret bodily symptoms as evidence that they 
may have one or more life-threatening illnesses. Although individuals with panic disorder may 
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Panic disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
also manifest concerns that physical manifestations of anxiety are indicative of life-threatening 
illnesses (e.g. myocardial infarction), these symptoms typically occur in the midst of a panic attack. 
Individuals with panic disorder are more concerned about the recurrence of panic attacks or the 
significance of panic symptoms, are less likely to report somatic concerns attributable to bodily 
symptoms other than those associated with anxiety, and are less likely to engage in repetitive 
and excessive health-related behaviours. However, panic attacks can occur in hypochondriasis, 
and if they are exclusively associated with fears of having a life-threatening illness, an additional 
diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted. In this situation, the with panic attacks specifier can 
be applied to the diagnosis of hypochondriasis. If there are persistent and repetitive panic attacks 
in the context of hypochondriasis that are unexpected in the sense that they are not in response 
to illness-related concerns, both diagnoses should be assigned.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Irritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with panic disorder in children 
and adolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when presented with a task 
or situations that make them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to leave the home without a trusted 
companion such as a parent or caregiver). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggered 
by a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant 
disorder is generally not appropriate.
Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
Panic attacks can occur in the context of a variety of other mental disorders – particularly other 
anxiety and fear-related disorders, disorders specifically associated with stress, and obsessive-
compulsive and related disorders. When panic attacks occur in the context of these disorders, they 
are generally part of an intense anxiety response to a distressing internal or external stimulus that 
represents a focus of apprehension in that disorder (e.g. a particular object or situation in specific 
phobia, fear of negative social evaluation in social anxiety disorder, fear of being contaminated 
by germs in obsessive-compulsive disorder, fear of having a serious illness in hypochondriasis, 
reminders of a traumatic event in post-traumatic stress disorder). If panic attacks are limited to 
such situations in the context of another disorder, a separate diagnosis of panic disorder is not 
warranted. If some panic attacks over the course of the disorder have been unexpected and not 
exclusively in response to stimuli associated with the focus of apprehension related to another 
disorder, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.
Agoraphobia
Essential (required) features
•	 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs in, or in anticipation of, multiple situations 
where escape might be difficult or help might not be available is required for diagnosis. 
Examples include using public transportation, or being in crowds, outside the home alone, 
in shops or theatres, or standing in line.
•	 The individual is consistently fearful or anxious about these situations due to a fear of 
specific negative outcomes such as panic attacks, symptoms of panic, or other incapacitating 
(e.g. falling) or embarrassing physical symptoms (e.g. incontinence).
6B02
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The situations are actively avoided, are entered only under specific circumstances (e.g. in 
the presence of a companion), or else are endured with intense fear or anxiety.
•	 The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g. 
at least several months).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. paranoid 
ideation in delusional disorder, social withdrawal in depressive disorders).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant 
additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 The experiences feared by individuals with agoraphobia may include symptoms of a panic 
attack as described in panic disorder (e.g. palpitations or increased heart rate, chest pain, 
feelings of dizziness or lightheadedness) or other symptoms that may be incapacitating, 
frightening, difficult to manage or embarrassing (e.g. incontinence, changes in vision, 
vomiting). It is often important to establish quite specifically the nature of the feared 
outcome in agoraphobia, as this may inform the specific choice of treatment strategies.
•	 It is common for individuals with agoraphobia to have a history of panic attacks, although 
they may not currently meet the diagnostic requirements for panic disorder, or indeed 
may not have panic attacks at all because they avoid situations in which panic attacks 
may occur. Establishing that an individual’s focus of apprehension relates specifically to 
experiencing the bodily symptoms of a panic attack is important in considering whether to 
add components of panic disorder treatment (e.g. interoceptive exposure) to the treatment 
of agoraphobia, even when there is no current panic disorder diagnosis.
•	 Individuals with agoraphobia may employ a variety of different behavioural strategies if 
required to enter feared situations. One such “safety” behaviour is to require the presence 
of a companion. Other strategies may include going to certain places only at particular 
times of day, or carrying specific materials (e.g. medications, towels) in case of the feared 
negative outcome. These strategies may change over the course of the disorder and from 
one occasion to the next. For example, on different occasions in the same situation an 
individual may insist on having a companion, endure the situation with distress, or use 
various safety behaviours to cope with their anxiety.
•	 Although the pattern of symptoms, the severity of the anxiety and the extent of avoidance 
are variable, agoraphobia is one of the most impairing of the anxiety and fear-related 
disorders to the extent that some individuals become completely housebound; this has an 
impact on opportunities for employment, seeking medical care and the ability to form and 
maintain relationships.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Individuals may exhibit transient avoidance behaviours in the context of normal 
development or in periods of increased stress. These behaviours are differentiated from 
agoraphobia because they are limited in duration and do not lead to significant impact on 
functioning.
•	 Individuals with disabilities or medical conditions may avoid certain situations because 
of reasonable concerns about being incapacitated or embarrassed (e.g. a person with a 
mobility limitation who is concerned that an unfamiliar location will not be accessible, 
a person with Crohn disease who is concerned about experiencing sudden diarrhoea). 
Agoraphobia should only be diagnosed if the anxiety and avoidance result in functional 
impairment that is greater than expected given the disability or health condition.
Course features
•	 The typical age of onset for agoraphobia is in late adolescence, with the majority of 
individuals experiencing onset before 35 years of age. However, age of onset is later (during 
the mid- to late 20s) for individuals without a history of panic attacks or pre-existing 
diagnosis of panic disorder. Onset during childhood is considered rare.
•	 Agoraphobia is generally considered a chronic and persistent condition. The long-term 
course and outcome of agoraphobia is associated with increased risk of developing 
depressive disorders, dysthymic disorder and disorders due to substance use.
•	 Greater symptom severity (e.g. avoidance of most activities, being housebound) is 
associated with higher rates of relapse and chronicity, and a poorer long-term prognosis.
•	 The presence of co-occurring disorders – particularly other anxiety and fear-related 
disorders, depressive disorders, personality disorder and disorders due to substance use – 
has been associated with a poorer long-term prognosis.
Developmental presentations
•	 Although the clinical features of agoraphobia generally remain consistent across the 
lifespan, specific triggers and related cognitions can vary across age groups. For example, 
whereas fear of being outside the home alone or becoming lost are common during 
childhood, adults are more likely to fear standing in line, being in crowded or open spaces, 
or experiencing a panic attack. Among older adults, fear of falling is common.
•	 As with adults, children and adolescents with agoraphobia may demonstrate excessive 
avoidance of certain situations or locations, or require the presence of a close friend or family 
member to enter these situations. Children with agoraphobia are likely to resist leaving the

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

home without a parent or caregiver. A common focus of apprehension is becoming lost 
and not being able to obtain help. Soliciting information from collateral informants who 
know the child well can assist in clarifying the child’s focus of apprehension.
Culture-related features
•	 Assessment of agoraphobia should incorporate information on cultural and gender norms. 
For example, fear of leaving the home among populations and contexts in which violence 
is common should not be assigned this diagnosis unless the fear is in excess of what is 
culturally normative. Likewise, for individuals in cultures who spend most of their time 
at home, anxiety when in open areas (e.g. markets) may be expected; the disorder should 
only be diagnosed when the fear exceeds cultural norms.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Lifetime prevalence of agoraphobia is approximately twice as high among women. Among 
children, it is more frequently reported in girls, with symptom onset occurring earlier for 
girls than boys.
•	 Men with agoraphobia are more likely to report co-occurring disorders due to substance use.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with panic disorder
It is common for individuals with panic disorder to develop some degree of agoraphobic 
symptoms over time. If the individual experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks that are 
not restricted to particular stimuli or situations, and agoraphobic symptoms do not meet the 
full diagnostic requirements for agoraphobia, then panic disorder is the appropriate diagnosis. 
Conversely, many individuals with agoraphobia have experienced recurrent panic attacks. If an 
individual with agoraphobia experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of the multiple 
agoraphobic situations without the presence of unexpected panic attacks, an additional diagnosis 
of panic disorder is not warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using 
the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional 
diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with specific phobia
Specific phobia is differentiated from agoraphobia because it involves fear of circumscribed 
situations or stimuli themselves (e.g. heights, animals, blood or injury) rather than fear or anxiety 
of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation 
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where 
obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
In social anxiety disorder, symptoms occur in response to feared social situations (e.g. speaking 
in public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negatively 
evaluated by others.
Boundary with separation anxiety disorder
As with agoraphobia, individuals with separation anxiety disorder avoid situations but, in 
contrast, they do so to prevent or limit being away from individuals to whom they are attached 
(e.g. parent, spouse, or child) for fear of losing them.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may avoid situations as 
a consequence of persecutory or paranoid delusions rather than because of fear or anxiety of 
imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation, 
or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where 
obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.
Boundary with depressive disorders
In depressive disorders, individuals may avoid multiple situations, but do so because of loss of 
interest in previously pleasurable activities or due to lack of energy rather than because of fear 
or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, 
incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple 
situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder
In post-traumatic stress disorder, the individual deliberately avoids reminders likely to produce 
re-experiencing of the traumatic event. In contrast, situations are avoided in agoraphobia because 
of fear or anxiety of imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms 
of panic, incapacitation, or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in 
multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Irritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children and 
adolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to enter situations 
that make them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to leave the home without a trusted companion 
such as a parent or caregiver). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggered by a situation 
or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is 
generally not appropriate.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Agoraphobia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Specific phobia
Essential (required) features
•	 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that consistently occurs upon exposure or anticipation 
of exposure to one or more specific objects or situations (e.g. proximity to certain kinds of 
animals, heights, enclosed spaces, sight of blood or injury), and that is out of proportion to 
the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or else endured with intense fear or 
anxiety.
•	 A pattern of fear, anxiety or avoidance related to specific objects or situations is not 
transient – that is, it persists for an extended period of time (e.g. at least several months).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. social anxiety 
disorder, a primary psychotic disorder).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant 
additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Specific phobia encompasses fears of a broad and heterogeneous group of phobic stimuli. 
The most common are for particular animals (animal phobia), heights (acrophobia), 
enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), sight of blood or injury (blood-injury phobia), flying, 
driving, storms, darkness and medical/dental procedures. Individuals’ reactions to phobic 
stimuli can range from feelings of disgust and revulsion (often occurring in animal phobias 
or blood-injury phobias), to anticipation of danger or harm (common across most types 
of specific phobia) and physical symptoms such as fainting (most common in response to 
blood or injury).
•	 The majority of individuals diagnosed with specific phobia report fear of multiple objects 
or situations. A single diagnosis of specific phobia is assigned regardless of the number 
of feared objects or situations. Unlike most phobic stimuli, which upon presentation or 
anticipation typically result in significant physiological arousal, individuals who fear the 
sight of blood, invasive medical procedures or injury may experience a vasovagal response 
that can result in a fainting spell.
•	 Some individuals with specific phobia may report a history of having observed another 
person (e.g. a caregiver) react with fear or anxiety when confronted by an object or situation, 
resulting in vicarious learning of a fear response to the object or situation. Others may have 
had a direct negative experience with an object or situation (e.g. having been bitten by a 
dog). However, previous negative experiences (direct or vicarious) are not necessary for 
the development of the disorder.
6B03
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
•	 Some individuals report that their fear or anxiety for an object or situation is not excessive. 
As such, clinicians must consider whether the reported fear, anxiety or avoidance behaviour 
is disproportionate to the reasonable risk of harm, taking into consideration both accepted 
cultural norms and the specific environmental conditions that the individual is normally 
subjected to (e.g. fear of darkness may be justified in a neighbourhood where assaults are 
common at night).
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 In children and adolescents, some fears may be part of normal development (e.g. a young 
child who is afraid of dogs). Specific phobia should only be diagnosed if the fear or anxiety 
is excessive in comparison to that of other individuals at a similar developmental level.
Course features
•	 Onset of specific phobia can occur at any age; however, initial onset is most common 
during early childhood (between 7 and 10 years of age), typically as a result of witnessing 
or experiencing a fear-provoking situation or event (e.g. choking, being attacked by an 
animal, witnessing someone drown).
•	 Younger age of onset has been associated with phobias related to animal and natural 
phenomena (fear of still water/weather, closed spaces), whereas fear of flying and height-
related phobias generally have an older age of onset.
•	 Younger age of onset is also associated with an increased number of feared situations 
or stimuli.
•	 Individuals with specific phobia report high lifetime rates of co-occurring 
disorders – particularly depressive disorders and other anxiety and fear-related disorders. 
In the majority of cases, specific phobia precedes the onset of other mental disorders.
•	 Specific phobias that persist from childhood into adolescence and adulthood rarely 
remit spontaneously.
Developmental presentations
•	 Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhood 
and adolescence. Among these conditions, specific phobia is one of the most common in 
young children, and may present in children as young as 3 years of age.
•	 In children, the diagnosis of specific phobia should not be assigned when the fears are 
developmentally normative (e.g. fear of the dark in young children).
•	 In preschool-aged children, phobic responses may include freezing, tantrums or crying. 
Duration, frequency and intensity of these reactions may be used to distinguish between 
age-typical fears and anxiety responses in specific phobia.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Specific phobias related to tangible objects (e.g. animals) are more common in younger 
children, whereas those relating to possible harm to oneself or others (e.g. environmental, 
blood/injection) are more common in adolescents and adults.
•	 As with adults, excessive avoidance is seen in both children and adolescents, and may 
be driven by either the actual presence of the phobic stimuli or anticipatory anxiety 
(e.g. refusing to go outside because of the possible presence of bees).
Culture-related features
•	 Culture may play a role in shaping the fear response to specific stimuli. A diagnosis of 
specific phobia should not be assigned if a stimulus is feared by most people in a cultural 
group, unless the fear exceeds cultural norms. For example, people from some cultural 
groups may avoid walking at night in certain areas where they fear ghosts or spirits may 
be present.
•	 The salience of specific feared stimuli may differ by cultural group and environmental 
context. Common threats in the environment (e.g. poisonous snakes) may account for 
some of the cultural variation in feared stimuli.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Lifetime prevalence of specific phobia is approximately twice as high among females.
•	 Whereas males and females are equally likely to experience phobias related to blood, 
injection and injury, situationally specific phobias and those related to animals and natural 
environments are more common among females.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with panic disorder
If an individual with specific phobia experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of 
actual or anticipated encounters with the specific object or situation that represents the focus 
of apprehension, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted, and the presence 
of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks specifier. However, if unexpected 
panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with agoraphobia
Specific phobia is differentiated from agoraphobia because it involves fear of circumscribed 
situations or stimuli (e.g. heights, animals, blood-injury) rather than because of fear or anxiety of 
imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation 
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are anticipated to occur in multiple situations where 
obtaining help or escaping might be difficult.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
In social anxiety disorder, the fear and avoidance are triggered by social situations (e.g. speaking 
in public, initiating a conversation), and the primary focus of apprehension is being negatively 
evaluated by others, whereas in specific phobia, the fear and avoidance is in response to other 
specific objects or situations.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
In obsessive-compulsive disorder, individuals may avoid specific stimuli or situations related to 
obsessions or compulsions (e.g. avoiding “contaminated” situations in someone with a hand-
washing compulsion), whereas in specific phobia, objects or situations are avoided because of 
fear associated with them and not because of obsessions or compulsions.
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
In hypochondriasis, individuals may avoid medical consultations or hospitals because of a fear 
that it will exacerbate their preoccupation with having a serious disease. In contrast, in specific 
phobia the fear and avoidance are related to the specific object or situation itself.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Both specific phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder involve avoidance of stimuli that cause 
anxiety, and both may arise following exposure to a traumatic event. Post-traumatic stress disorder 
can be differentiated from specific phobia by the presence of the other core symptoms of post-
traumatic stress disorder (re-experiencing the trauma and persistent perceptions of heightened 
current threat). They are further differentiated by the fact that – unlike in specific phobia, in 
which the memories of the related traumatic event are experienced as belonging to the past – in 
post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, the traumatic event is 
experienced as if it were occurring again in the here and now (i.e. re-experiencing).
Boundary with feeding and eating disorders
Individuals with feeding and eating disorders exhibit abnormal eating behaviour and/or 
preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight or shape concerns, and may avoid 
food because they fear it will lead to weight gain or because of its specific sensory qualities. In 
some specific phobias, individuals may avoid eating or food stimuli, but the avoidance is related to 
the anticipated direct effect of the phobic stimulus (e.g. eating may lead to choking or vomiting) 
rather than because of the caloric content or sensory qualities of the food itself.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Irritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children and 
adolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to interact with a 
stimulus or enter situations that make them feel anxious (e.g. asking a child who fears dogs to go 
to the park where dogs might be present). If the defiant behaviours only occur when triggered 
by a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant 
disorder is generally not appropriate.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Specific phobia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Social anxiety disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety that occurs consistently in one or more social 
situations such as social interactions (e.g. having a conversation), doing something while 
feeling observed (e.g. eating or drinking in the presence of others) or performing in front 
of others (e.g. giving a speech) is required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual is concerned that they will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will 
be negatively evaluated by others (i.e. be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejection or 
be offensive).
•	 Relevant social situations are consistently avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.
•	 The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g. 
at least several months).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia, 
body dysmorphic disorder, olfactory reference disorder).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant 
additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Individuals with social anxiety disorder may report concerns about physical symptoms – 
such as blushing, sweating or trembling – rather than initially endorsing fears of negative 
evaluation.
•	 Social anxiety disorder frequently co-occurs with other anxiety and fear-related disorders 
and depressive disorders.
•	 Individuals with social anxiety disorder are at higher risk of developing disorders due to 
substance use, which may arise subsequent to use for the purposes of attenuating anxiety 
symptoms in social situations.
•	 Individuals with social anxiety disorder may not view their fear or anxiety in response to 
social situations as excessive. As such, clinical judgement should be applied to determine 
whether the reported fear, anxiety or avoidance behaviour is disproportionate to what the 
social situation warrants, taking into consideration both accepted cultural norms and the 
specific environmental circumstances to which the individual is subjected (e.g. fear of 
interacting with peers may be appropriate if the individual is being bullied).
6B04
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Social anxiety disorder can be differentiated from normal developmental fears (e.g. a 
child’s reluctance to interact with unfamiliar people in novel situations) by fear and anxiety 
reactions that are typically excessive, interfere with functioning, and persist over time (e.g. 
lasting more than several months).
•	 Many individuals experience fear in social situations (e.g. it is common for individuals to 
experience anxiety about speaking in public) or manifest the normal personality trait of 
shyness. Social anxiety disorder should only be considered in cases in which the individual 
reports social fear, anxiety, and avoidance that are clearly in excess of what is normative for 
the specific cultural context and result in significant distress or impairment.
Course features
•	 Although onset of social anxiety disorder can occur during early childhood, onset typically 
occurs during childhood and adolescence, with a large majority of cases emerging between 
8 and 15 years of age.
•	 Onset of social anxiety disorder can be gradual or occur precipitously subsequent to a 
stressful or humiliating social experience.
•	 Social anxiety disorder is generally considered to be a chronic condition; however, later age 
of onset, less severe level of impairment and absence of co-occurring disorders have been 
associated with spontaneous remission among individuals in the community.
•	 High rates of co-occurring mental disorders make it difficult to distinguish long-term 
prognosis attributable specifically to social anxiety disorder. A poorer long-term prognosis 
has been associated with greater symptom severity and co-occurring disorders due to 
use of alcohol, personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and 
agoraphobia.
•	 Remission rates for social anxiety disorder vary widely, with some individuals experiencing 
spontaneous remission of symptoms.
Developmental presentations
•	 Social anxiety disorder is less prevalent among young children under the age of 10 years, 
with occurrence of the disorder increasing significantly during adolescence.
•	 In children, the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should not be used to describe 
developmentally normative stranger anxiety or shyness.
•	 Social anxiety disorder is associated with the temperamental trait of behavioural inhibition 
– that is, the tendency for some individuals to experience novel situations as distressing 
and to withdraw from or avoid unfamiliar contexts or people. Behaviourally inhibited 
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

children are “slow to warm up” to new people and new situations. Behavioural inhibition 
is considered to be a normal variation in temperament, but is also a risk factor for the 
development of social anxiety disorder.
•	 As with adults, children and adolescents may employ subtle avoidance strategies during 
social situations to manage their anxiety, including limiting speech or making poor eye 
contact with others. Children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder may also 
evidence social skills deficits, such as difficulty with starting or maintaining conversations 
or asserting their wishes or opinions.
•	 Social anxiety disorder symptoms may only become evident with the start of school, 
with the onset of demands to interact socially with unfamiliar peers and teachers. The 
manifestations of social anxiety disorder may also vary across age groups, with younger 
children more likely to exhibit social anxiety primarily with adults, and adolescents 
more likely to experience increased social anxiety with peers. There are also individual 
differences with respect to the degree of social anxiety experienced when interacting with 
members of the same or opposite sex. Soliciting information from collateral informants 
who know the child well about how they react in various situations and contexts can assist 
in making the diagnosis.
•	 Social anxiety disorder symptoms may become more evident with age, as social demands 
exceed individuals’ capabilities to cope with and manage their anxiety. Adolescents may 
exhibit various associated difficulties, including social withdrawal, school refusal and 
reluctance to assert their needs. Some adolescents may participate in social situations for fear 
of the consequences to their social status if they do not, but do so with significant distress.
Culture-related features
•	 Identification of social anxiety disorder may depend on assessment of social situations 
relevant to the cultural group (e.g. being expected to dance in public among some Latin 
American cultures) that may be associated with excessive anxiety, and of whether the 
degree of anxiety is outside the cultural norms for the individual. To avoid stereotyping, 
individuals should be asked openly about social situations associated with excessive anxiety.
•	 Anxiety and avoidance of certain social situations may be considered normative in some 
cultural groups (e.g. public speaking or voicing dissent in some Asian cultures), and 
therefore may not indicate a disorder unless this fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the 
actual danger posed by the social situation when considering the sociocultural context.
•	 Some cultural concepts of distress are related to social anxiety disorder. For example, taijin 
kyofusho among Japanese people and related conditions among people in the Republic of 
Korea may represent a form of social anxiety disorder associated with the fear that others 
will be offended by one’s own inappropriate social behaviour (e.g. inappropriate gaze or 
facial expression, blushing, body odour, loud bowel sounds). Other presentations of taijin 
kyofusho may be better captured by a diagnosis of delusional disorder, body dysmorphic 
disorder or olfactory reference disorder.
•	 Prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder may not follow self-reported social anxiety 
levels in the same culture – that is, societies with strong collectivistic orientations may 
report high levels of social anxiety but lower prevalence of social anxiety disorder. This 
may be due to higher tolerance for socially reticent and withdrawn behaviours, resulting in 
better psychosocial functioning, or to lower recognition of social anxiety disorder.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Whereas prevalence rates for social anxiety disorder are higher for women in community 
samples, gender differences are not observed in clinical samples. The disparity in prevalence 
across settings has been attributed to gender role expectations, such that men experiencing 
greater severity of symptoms are more willing to seek professional services.
•	 Women report greater symptom severity and a greater variety of social fears, whereas men 
are more likely to experience anxiety related to dating and urinating in public.
•	 Co-occurring depressive, bipolar and anxiety and fear-related disorders are more common 
among women, whereas men are more likely to experience co-occurring oppositional 
defiant disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder and disorders due to substance use.
•	 The use of alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve symptoms of social anxiety disorder is more 
common among men.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder can be differentiated from social anxiety disorder because the main 
focus of worry is negative consequences that can occur in multiple everyday situations (e.g. 
work, relationships, finances) rather than being restricted to concerns about one’s behaviour or 
appearance being negatively evaluated in social situations.
Boundary with panic disorder
If an individual with social anxiety disorder experiences panic attacks exclusively in the context of 
actual or anticipated social or performance situations, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder 
is not warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks 
specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panic 
disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with agoraphobia
Fear or anxiety in agoraphobia centres on imminent perceived dangerous outcomes (e.g. 
panic attacks, symptoms of panic, incapacitation or embarrassing physical symptoms) that are 
anticipated to occur in multiple situations where obtaining help or escaping might be difficult 
rather than on concerns about being negatively evaluated by others. Unlike social anxiety disorder, 
embarrassment in agoraphobia is secondary to concerns that escape or obtaining assistance may 
not be possible should symptoms (e.g. diarrhoea in a public place) occur.
Boundary with specific phobia
Specific phobia can be differentiated from social anxiety disorder because, in general, fears are 
of specific situations or stimuli (e.g. heights, animals, blood-injury) and not of social situations.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with selective mutism
Selective mutism is characterized by a failure to speak in specific situations, whereas in social 
anxiety disorder fear and anxiety result in avoidance of multiple social contexts.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder and social anxiety disorder may both appear to 
be socially withdrawn. However, those with autism spectrum disorder can be differentiated 
because of the presence of social communication deficits and, typically, a lack of interest in social 
interactions.
Boundary with depressive disorders
Beliefs of social inadequacy, rejection and failure are common in depressive disorders, and may 
be associated with avoidance of social situations. However, unlike in social anxiety disorder, these 
symptoms occur almost exclusively during a depressive episode.
Boundary with body dysmorphic disorder
In body dysmorphic disorder, individuals worry about a perceived physical defect that is often 
undetectable or very minor from the point of view of others. These individuals may be concerned 
about others’ negative judgement of the perceived defect. However, unlike in social anxiety 
disorder, their concerns are restricted to how others will evaluate the perceived defect rather than 
other aspects of their behaviour or appearance across social contexts.
Boundary with olfactory reference disorder
In social anxiety disorder, social situations are avoided because the individual is concerned that 
they will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e. 
be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejection or be offensive). In contrast, individuals with 
olfactory reference disorder may avoid social situations specifically because they believe they are 
emitting a foul odour.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Irritability, anger and noncompliance are sometimes associated with anxiety in children and 
adolescents. For example, children may exhibit angry outbursts when asked to enter situations that 
make them feel anxious (e.g. being asked to attend a social gathering). If the defiant behaviours 
only occur when triggered by a situation or stimulus that elicits anxiety, fear or panic, a diagnosis 
of oppositional defiant disorder is generally not appropriate.
Boundary with other mental and behavioural syndromes due to another medical 
condition
Individuals with certain medical conditions (e.g. Parkinson disease) and those with other mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia) may demonstrate avoidance 
of social situations because of concerns that others will negatively evaluate their symptoms 
(e.g. tremor, unusual behaviours). An additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should only 
be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met, taking into consideration that it is normal for 
individuals with visible symptoms of a medical condition to experience some concerns about how 
others perceive their symptoms. Typically, individuals with medical conditions adapt to concerns 
related to their manifest symptoms and do not display persistent excessive fear or anxiety in 
social situations.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Social anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Separation anxiety disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Marked and excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom 
the person is attached (i.e. with whom the individual has a deep emotional bond) is 
required for diagnosis. In children and adolescents, key attachment figures that are most 
commonly the focus of separation anxiety include parents, caregivers and other family 
members, and the fear or anxiety is beyond what would be considered developmentally 
normative. In adults, separation anxiety most often involves a spouse, romantic partner or 
children. Manifestations of fear or anxiety related to separation depend on the individual’s 
developmental level, but may include:
•	 persistent thoughts that harm or some other untoward event (e.g. being kidnapped) will 
lead to separation;
•	 reluctance or refusal to go to school or work;
•	 recurrent excessive distress (e.g. tantrums, social withdrawal) related to being separated 
from the attachment figure;
•	 reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near the attachment figure;
•	 recurrent nightmares about separation;
•	 physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or headache on occasions 
that involve separation from the attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to school 
or work.
•	 The symptoms are not transient – that is, they persist for an extended period of time (e.g. 
at least several months).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. agoraphobia, 
personality disorder).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress about experiencing persistent anxiety symptoms 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant 
additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Separation anxiety disorder frequently co-occurs with other mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders. In children and adolescents, common co-occurring 
disorders include generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. In adults, frequently 
co-occurring disorders include mood disorders, other anxiety and fear-related disorders, 
post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorder.
6B05
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Although separation anxiety disorder may exhibit a lifelong course with onset in 
childhood, a significant proportion of adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recall 
a childhood onset.
•	 Separation anxiety disorder in childhood is frequently associated with a parenting style 
that interferes with the development of autonomy and self-mastery expected for that 
person’s cultural context (e.g. the parent does not permit the child to engage independently 
in basic activities of daily living such as dressing and bathing).
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Many situations involving separation are associated with other potential stressors or are 
normal sources of anxiety (e.g. leaving home to start a job or attend university in a new 
city). Separation anxiety disorder is differentiated based on the focus of apprehension 
being on separation from a key attachment figure rather than on other aspects of adjusting 
to novel circumstances.
•	 Strong attachment to loved ones is a normal and healthy part of life, and separation from 
these individuals may be associated with transient sadness or anxiety. Preschool-aged 
children may show a moderate or even greater degree of anxiety over real or threatened 
separation from people to whom they are attached. These reactions are considered 
developmentally appropriate, and are differentiated from separation anxiety disorder on 
the basis of the persistence of the symptoms (e.g. lasting for several months) with repeated 
separations, evidence of excessive preoccupations about the well-being of attachment 
figures, persistent avoidance, and significant distress or impairment in functioning as a 
consequence of the symptoms.
•	 Among children and adolescents, school refusal is a common occurrence, and may be 
based on transient anxiety about separation from a loved one or be symptomatic of 
separation anxiety disorder. However, especially in adolescence, anxiety about school or 
school refusal is not typically related to fear of separation but rather to other factors such 
as truancy, peer rejection or bullying.
Course features
•	 The typical onset of separation anxiety disorder is during childhood, and the disorder can 
persist into adulthood. Initial disorder onset during adolescence and adulthood may be 
less common.
•	 Separation anxiety disorder has been associated with elevated risk of developing a wide 
range of internalizing disorders, including depressive disorders, bipolar disorders and 
anxiety and fear-related disorders. There is also evidence of elevated risk of disruptive 
behaviour and dissocial disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Developmental presentations
•	 Anxiety and fear-related disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders of childhood 
and adolescence. Among these disorders, separation anxiety disorder is one of the most 
common in young children.
•	 In children, the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder should not be used to describe 
developmentally normative phenomena.
•	 The focus of apprehension in separation anxiety disorder may differ across age groups, such 
that younger children may demonstrate less credible fears (e.g. worrying about sleeping 
alone for fear they will be kidnapped in the middle of the night), whereas older children 
and adolescents may have more credible fears (e.g. parents being in a car accident).
•	 Symptom presentation varies with age. In younger children, who are less able to express 
worries or fears, behavioural manifestations of recurrent excessive distress are typically 
more prominent, such as tantrums or crying when separated from parents and caregivers. 
When at home, younger children may insist on following caregivers closely, exhibiting 
distress even when in a different room or on a different floor from parents or caregivers. 
Older children are usually able to express their preoccupations about separation from 
attachment figures or fears related to specific dangers (e.g. accidents, kidnapping, 
mugging, death). Older children and adolescents may be more likely to demonstrate social 
withdrawal, insisting on staying at home with family members rather than spending time 
with peers.
Culture-related features
•	 Cultural variation exists with regard to tolerating separation from attachment figures. In 
some cultural groups, it would be considered inappropriate to spend time apart from family 
or loved ones. Distress associated with separation in this sociocultural context should not 
be considered excessive if it is culturally normative.
•	 Children in some cultures remain in their parental home longer than in other cultures, and 
generally this trend is increasing globally, so the assignment of disorder should take into 
account cultural norms.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although lifetime prevalence rates for separation anxiety disorder are slightly higher 
among females than males (5.6% versus 4%), during childhood, school refusal is equally 
prevalent for both genders.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder experience chronic and excessive worry about a 
variety of everyday life events that can include preoccupation about the safety of key attachment 
figures. However, these concerns seldom occur without additional worries regarding other 
domains of everyday life.
Boundary with panic disorder
If an individual with separation anxiety disorder experiences panic attacks exclusively in the 
context of separation from key attachment figures, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is 
not warranted, and the presence of panic attacks may be indicated using the with panic attacks 
specifier. However, if unexpected panic attacks also occur, an additional diagnosis of panic 
disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with agoraphobia
In agoraphobia, individuals avoid a variety of situations, including leaving home alone, but the 
fear or anxiety is centred on the possibility that help will not be available in the event of a panic 
attack or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms rather than concerns about separation 
from key attachment figures.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
In social anxiety disorder, the avoidance of social situations is in response to fear or anxiety 
about being negatively evaluated by others rather than concerns about being separated from key 
attachment figures.
Boundary with depressive disorders
Beliefs of social inadequacy, rejection and failure are common in depressive disorders, and 
may be associated with avoidance of leaving the home and being separated from loved ones. 
However, unlike in separation anxiety disorder, these symptoms occur almost exclusively during 
a depressive episode.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder
In post-traumatic stress disorder, individuals have a history of exposure to a traumatic event 
that may have involved the loss of a key attachment figure. However, the focus of apprehension 
is on intrusive re-experiencing of the traumatic event from memory and avoidance of associated 
stimuli rather than concerns about future loss of or harm coming to the key attachment figure. 
Nevertheless, separation anxiety disorder rather than post-traumatic stress disorder may occur 
subsequent to the experience of a traumatic event, and if all diagnostic requirements are met, the 
diagnosis can be assigned.
Boundary with disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder can exhibit similar behaviours to those observed 
in separation anxiety disorder, such as anger, irritability and temper outbursts, or defiant and 
headstrong behaviour (e.g. refusal to leave home or go to school). However, in separation 
anxiety disorder these occur exclusively as a result of anticipated or actual separation from a 
key attachment figure. School refusal or truancy may occur in the context of conduct-dissocial 
disorder, but the behaviour is not related to concerns for the well-being of a key attachment figure.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Separation anxiety disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Boundary with personality disorder
Fear of abandonment or dependency on others can occur as symptoms of an enduring 
maladaptive pattern of behaviour associated with personality disorder. These symptoms tend 
to occur with other broader disruptions to interpersonal functioning, emotion regulation, and 
identity formation and definition. Personality disorder may co-occur with separation anxiety 
disorder and, if present, can be diagnosed separately.
Selective mutism
Essential (required) features
•	 Consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child demonstrates adequate language 
competence in specific social situations (typically at home) but consistently fails to speak 
in others (typically at school) is required for diagnosis.
•	 The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month, not limited to the first month of school.
•	 The disturbance is not due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language 
demanded in the social situation.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a 
neurodevelopmental disorder such as autism spectrum disorder or developmental 
language disorder).
•	 Selectivity of speech is sufficiently severe to interfere with educational achievement or with 
social communication, or is associated with significant impairment in other important 
areas of functioning.
Additional clinical features
•	 Symptoms of selective mutism may interfere with direct assessment of expressive 
language. However, many affected children cooperate with receptive language testing if 
communication is restricted to carrying out commands or pointing to pictures, which can 
provide valuable information about a child’s general language levels. Furthermore, reports 
from informants who know the child well (e.g. a parent or caregiver) may be necessary to 
establish that the child can speak in certain social situations.
•	 Selective mutism is often regarded as a variant of social anxiety disorder because affected 
individuals experience significant anxiety in social situations and, when able to express 
themselves, indicate that they fear negative evaluation – in particular of their speech. 
However, unlike social anxiety disorder, children with selective mutism are more likely 
to display these difficulties at an earlier age of onset (in most cases before the age of 5 
years, although it may only become apparent when starting school), are more likely to have 
associated subtle language impairments, and exhibit oppositional behaviour in response to 
being asked to speak in feared situations.
6B06
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Selective mutism

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Co-occurrence with other anxiety and fear-related disorders (particularly social anxiety 
disorder, separation anxiety disorder and specific phobias) is very common among 
individuals with selective mutism.
•	 Selective mutism is associated with severe impairment in academic and social functioning 
that can manifest as inability to complete expected schoolwork, not getting needed 
assistance or support (because the child does not ask for it), inability to initiate or 
reciprocate social interactions with peers, or becoming the target of bullying.
•	 Social anxiety, withdrawal and avoidance in selective mutism may be related to 
temperamental factors such as behavioural inhibition and negative affectivity.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Transient reluctance to speak at the time of first starting school is a common occurrence. 
Selective mutism should only be diagnosed if symptoms persist beyond the first month of 
schooling. Immigrant children who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in the official 
language of their new host country may, for a discrete period of time, refuse to speak to 
strangers in their new environment. This may also occur with children from linguistic 
minorities. Selective mutism should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Course features
•	 Although the onset of selective mutism typically occurs during early childhood (i.e. prior 
to the age of 5 years), significant impairment of functioning may not manifest until entry 
into school, when children experience increased demands to speak publicly (e.g. reading 
aloud) and engage socially.
•	 A majority of children with selective mutism will present with symptoms of another 
anxiety or fear-related disorder – particularly social anxiety disorder.
•	 Children with selective mutism may also display signs of oppositionality – particularly 
in situations requiring speech. A co-occurring diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder 
should not be assigned if refusal to speak can be entirely accounted for by features of 
selective mutism.
•	 The course of selective mutism varies among individuals. Although the average duration 
of the disorder is 8 years, after which symptoms begin to dissipate or remit completely, 
some individuals may experience a persistence of symptoms or a manifestation of another 
disorder – primarily social anxiety disorder.
•	 Even after the core symptoms of selective mutism resolve, individuals often continue to 
experience difficulties related to social communication and anxiety.
•	 A poorer prognosis is associated with a family history of selective mutism.
Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Selective mutism

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
Culture-related features
•	 People in cultures with a high level of shame-based emotions may avoid speaking about 
particular topics or in situations that would evoke shame for themselves or others. When 
this is culturally normative, it should not be considered to be reflective of selective mutism.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with developmental speech and language disorders
Selective mutism is differentiated from the range of developmental speech and language disorders 
(i.e. language disorders or speech fluency disorder) that involve impairments in expressive 
language across all social situations. Although some children with selective mutism exhibit 
expressive language difficulties or phonological problems, these are often subtle, and functioning 
is usually found to be in the normal range. Selective mutism may occur in the presence of 
developmental speech and language disorders, and both can be diagnosed if warranted.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder and disorders of intellectual development
Some individuals affected by autism spectrum disorder or disorders of intellectual development 
exhibit impairments in language and social communication. However, unlike in selective mutism, 
when language and communication impairments are present in autism spectrum disorder and 
disorders of intellectual development, they are notable across environments and social situations.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorder
Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may exhibit disruptions 
in speech and social communication as a function of symptoms of disordered thought. Unlike 
individuals with selective mutism, those with disrupted communication in the context of 
psychotic disorders display similar disruptions to speech across all social situations.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
Selective mutism is characterized by a failure to speak in specific situations, whereas in social 
anxiety disorder fear and anxiety result in avoidance of multiple social contexts.

Other specified anxiety or fear-related disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by anxiety symptoms that share primary clinical features 
with other anxiety and fear-related disorders (e.g. physiological symptoms of excessive 
arousal, apprehension and avoidance behaviour).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
anxiety and fear-related disorders grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. a mood disorder, an obsessive-compulsive or related 
disorder).
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, 
including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Anxiety or fear-related disorder, unspecified
Specifier for anxiety and fear-related disorders
with panic attacks
This specifier can be applied to indicate the presence of panic attacks within the past month 
that manifest in the context of anxiety and fear-related disorders, as well as other disorders such 
as obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. The with panic attacks specifier should not be 
assigned when panic attacks can be entirely explained by a panic disorder diagnosis. Recurrent 
panic attacks that occur in the context of other mental disorders may be indicative of greater 
severity of psychopathology, poorer response to treatment and greater risk of suicide in the 
context of mood disorders.
When panic attacks occur in the context of other anxiety and fear-related disorders, they are 
conceptualized as episodes of severe anxiety that occur specifically in response to exposure

Anxiety and fear-related disorders | Other specified or unspecified anxiety or fear-related disorder

Anxiety and fear-related disorders
to, or anticipation of exposure to, the feared stimulus or stimuli (i.e. they reflect the focus of 
apprehension specific to the disorder). For example, panic attacks may occur in separation anxiety 
disorder during separation from a caregiver or partner, when exposed to the phobic situation or 
stimulus in specific phobia, or when entering social situations or speaking in public in social 
anxiety disorder. If panic attacks are limited to these types of situations, the with panic attacks 
specifier should be applied rather than an additional co-occurring diagnosis of panic disorder.
If some panic attacks over the course of the disorder have been unexpected and not exclusively in 
response to stimuli associated with the focus of apprehension related to the relevant disorder, a 
separate diagnosis of panic disorder should be assigned. In such cases, it is not necessary to apply 
the with panic attacks specifier.
For anxiety and fear-related disorders, application of the with panic attacks specifier produces 
the following combinations. (The with panic attacks specifier is not generally applicable to 
selective mutism.)

Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders
The disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders grouping are characterized by 
repetitive thoughts and behaviours. Although these also have some features in common with 
disorders in other groupings (e.g. anxiety and fear-related disorders), those included in the 
grouping of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders have commonalities on key diagnostic 
validators and frequently co-occur, which may be related in part to shared genetic factors.
Cognitive phenomena such as obsessions, intrusive thoughts and preoccupations are central 
to a subset of these conditions (obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, 
hypochondriasis and olfactory reference disorder), and are accompanied by related repetitive 
behaviours. Hoarding disorder is not associated with intrusive unwanted thoughts but rather 
characterized by a compulsive need to accumulate possessions and by distress related to discarding 
them. Also included in the grouping are body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders, which are 
primarily characterized by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the integument (e.g. hair 
pulling, skin picking) and lack a prominent cognitive aspect.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders include the following:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The level of insight an individual has with respect to disorder-specific beliefs varies, and can be 
specified for those obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in which cognitive phenomena 
are a key aspect of clinical phenomenology. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body 
dysmorphic disorder, olfactory reference disorder, hypochondriasis and hoarding disorder. 
The level of insight may be specified as fair to good or poor to absent, as described for each of 
these disorders.
In addition, Tourette syndrome, classified in the grouping primary tics and tic disorders in Chapter 
8 on diseases of the nervous system, is cross-listed here because of its high co-occurrence, familial 
association and analogous phenomenology (i.e. premonitory urges and repetitive behaviours) 
with obsessive-compulsive disorder:
Obsessive-compulsive disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of persistent obsessions and/or compulsions is required for diagnosis.
•	 Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g. of contamination), images 
(e.g. of violent scenes) or impulses/urges (e.g. to stab someone) that are experienced 
as intrusive and unwanted, and are commonly associated with anxiety. The individual 
typically attempts to ignore or suppress obsessions or to neutralize them by performing 
compulsions.
•	 Compulsions are repetitive behaviours or rituals, including repetitive mental acts, that 
the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid 
rules, or to achieve a sense of “completeness”. Examples of overt behaviours include 
repetitive washing, checking and ordering of objects. Examples of analogous mental 
acts include mentally repeating specific phrases in order to prevent negative outcomes, 
reviewing a memory to make sure that one has caused no harm, and mentally counting 
objects. Compulsions are either not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e.g. 
arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive 
(e.g. showering daily for hours to prevent illness).
•	 Obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (e.g. take more than 1 hour per day) 
or result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. 
basal ganglia ischaemic stroke), and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication 
on the central nervous system (e.g. amfetamine), including withdrawal effects.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Insight specifiers
Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder vary in the degree of insight they have about 
the accuracy of the beliefs that underlie their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although 
many can acknowledge that their thoughts or behaviours are untrue or excessive, some 
cannot, and the beliefs of a small minority of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder 
may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these 
beliefs are held (e.g. an individual is convinced that they will become seriously ill if they do 
not maintain their washing rituals). Insight may vary substantially even over short periods 
of time – for example, depending on the level of current anxiety or distress – and should be 
assessed with respect to a time period that is sufficient to allow for such fluctuation (e.g. a few 
days or a week). The degree of insight that an individual exhibits in the context of obsessive-
compulsive disorder can be specified as follows.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder with fair to good insight
•	 Much of the time, the individual is able to entertain the possibility that their disorder-
specific beliefs may not be true, and they are willing to accept an alternative explanation 
for their experience. This specifier level may still be applied if, at circumscribed times (e.g. 
when highly anxious), the individual demonstrates no insight.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder with poor to absent insight
•	 Most or all of the time, the individual is convinced that the disorder-specific beliefs are 
true, and they cannot accept an alternative explanation for their experience. The lack of 
insight exhibited by the individual does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 The content of obsessions and compulsions varies among individuals, and can be grouped 
into different themes or symptom dimensions, including cleaning (i.e. contamination 
obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (i.e. symmetry obsessions and repeating, 
ordering and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g. aggressive, sexual 
and religious obsessions) and related compulsions. Some individuals have difficulties 
discarding objects, and accumulate (i.e. hoard) them as a consequence of typical obsessions, 
such as fears of harming others (see boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related 
disorders under hoarding disorder). Individuals usually manifest symptoms on more than 
one dimension.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Although compulsions are not done for pleasure, their performance may result in 
temporary relief from anxiety or distress, or a temporary sense of completeness.
•	 Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder experience a range of affects when 
confronted with situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. These affects can 
include marked anxiety or panic attacks, strong feelings of disgust or a distressing sense of 
“incompleteness” or uneasiness until things look, feel or sound “just right”.
•	 Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often avoid people, places and things that 
trigger obsessions and compulsions.
•	 Common beliefs in obsessive-compulsive disorder include an inflated sense of responsibility, 
overestimation of threat, perfectionism, intolerance of uncertainty and overvaluation of 
the power of thoughts (e.g. believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting 
on it).
•	 The severity of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptomatology varies such that some 
individuals spend a few hours per day obsessing or engaging in compulsions, whereas 
others have near constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating.
•	 When both obsessions and compulsions are present there is typically a discernible 
relationship between them in content or temporal sequence. Compulsions are most 
often performed in response to obsessions (e.g. excessive hand washing due to fear of 
contamination). However, in some individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
particularly during the initial phase of the disorder, compulsions may precede the 
manifestation of obsessions. For example, an individual begins to feel that they must be 
afraid of an accidental fire because they repeatedly check the gas knob on the stove, or 
an individual concludes that they must be afraid of contamination based on the evidence 
of their repeated hand washing. Understanding the relationship between obsessions and 
compulsions can assist in intervention selection and treatment planning.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Intrusive thoughts, images and impulses/urges, as well as repetitive behaviours, are 
prevalent among the general population (e.g. thoughts of harming a loved one, double-
checking that the door is locked). Obsessive-compulsive disorder should only be diagnosed 
when obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming (e.g. take more than 1 hour per 
day), cause significant distress or result in functional impairment.
•	 Developmentally normative preoccupations (e.g. worrying about interacting with 
strangers in young children) and rituals (e.g. skipping over cracks in a sidewalk) should 
not be attributed to a presumptive diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. These are 
differentiated from obsessions and compulsions characteristic of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder because they are transient, age-appropriate and not time-consuming (e.g. taking 
more than hour per day), and they do not result in significant distress or impairment.
Course features
•	 Obsessive-compulsive disorder typically has an age of onset in the late teens and early 20s, 
with late onset (after 35 years of age) less common. In cases of late onset, there is often a 
history of chronic subclinical symptoms.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
•	 Onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms is often gradual. Sudden or late onset, 
in particular, should prompt additional assessment to differentiate obsessive-compulsive 
disorder from other medical conditions (e.g. basal ganglia ischaemic stroke) that may 
better explain the symptoms.
•	 Many adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (30–50%) report a childhood onset of 
symptoms. For those with onset during childhood or adolescence, 40% may experience 
remission of symptoms by early adulthood.
•	 Obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults is generally considered a chronic condition, with 
waxing and waning of symptoms. Some experience an episodic course and a minority 
experience a worsening course.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset before the age of 10 years is more common among males (approximately 25%), 
whereas adolescent onset is more likely among females. Younger age of onset is associated 
with greater genetic loading and poorer outcomes due to interference of symptoms with 
achieving developmental milestones (e.g. forming peer relationships, acquiring academic 
skills). Although childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder typically follows a 
chronic course, particularly if left untreated, symptoms tend to wax and wane and many 
(approximately 40%) experience full remission by early adulthood. Among older adults, the 
prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder is slightly higher among men than women.
•	 Although precipitous onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in children and 
adolescents has been reported, often attributed to paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric 
disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), development of symptoms 
is typically gradual.
•	 The content and type of obsessions and compulsions varies across the lifespan. Children 
and adolescents are more likely to report obsessions centred upon bad things happening 
to their loved ones (e.g. parents), whereas adolescents and adults are more likely to report 
religious or sexual obsessions. Among children and adolescents, females are more likely to 
report symptoms centred upon contamination or cleaning, whereas males are more likely 
to report symptoms of a sexual, religious or aggressive nature. It may be easier to assess for 
the presence of compulsions in children because their level of cognitive development may 
preclude verbalizing content of obsessions.
•	 Among children and adolescents, the course of obsessive-compulsive disorder is frequently 
complicated by the co-occurrence of other mental disorders, the presence of which may 
affect identification of obsessive-compulsive disorder among young people. Up to 30% of 
all individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder will also experience Tourette syndrome 
or another primary tic disorder during their lifetime. Co-occurring tics are more common 
among males with childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder. Children and 
adolescents are also more likely than adults to present with a combination of obsessive-
compulsive disorder, a primary tic disorder and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Body dysmorphic disorder or hoarding disorder often co-occur among adolescents with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Approximately half of elderly patients with obsessive-
compulsive disorder exhibit ordering, hoarding and checking behaviours, which may also 
reflect symptoms of personality disorder with anankastic traits.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Similar types of obsessive-compulsivity disorder symptoms (e.g. concerns with 
contamination) are present cross-culturally, but cultural variation exists in the salience 
and prevalence of certain themes of content of obsessions and compulsions. For example, 
aggressive obsessions have been found to predominate in Brazil, and religious/scrupulosity 
concerns in Middle Eastern settings. In addition, scrupulosity obsessions may be more 
distressing among individuals of certain faith groups that emphasize ritual exactitude 
or the sinful nature of certain kinds of thoughts. The influence of culture may lead to 
the adoption of specific themes, such as obsessions about kashrut (dietary restrictions) 
observances among Jews, or about being in a state of uncleanliness (napak) among 
Muslims. Distinguishing religious compulsions from zealous but normative religious 
practice may require the help of religious experts aware of local norms.
•	 Etiological attributions may vary across social groups, including biological, psychological, 
social and supernatural or spiritual explanations. These attributions may also shape the 
specific obsessions, such as concerns about being deserving of punishment as the result of 
a transgression or the object of sorcery, witchcraft or the evil eye. In some cultural groups, 
compulsions may be reinforced by the belief that such acts ward off evil spirits or have 
another spiritual function.
•	 Help-seeking behaviour and clinical disclosure are less likely when the obsessions or 
compulsions are considered by the individual to be culturally taboo.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Males are more likely to experience obsessive-compulsive disorder during childhood, 
with approximately 25% experiencing onset before the age of 10 years. During adulthood, 
prevalence is higher among females.
•	 Males are more likely to experience co-occurring primary tic disorders.
•	 Gender differences in the specific content of obsessions and compulsions have been 
reported, whereby females are more likely to report cleaning and contamination-related 
themes, and males are more likely to report symmetry-related themes and taboo intrusive 
thoughts (e.g. violent impulses, sacrilegious images).
•	 Onset or exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive disorder has been reported during the 
peripartum period.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
Hypochondriasis is characterized by persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility of 
having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses. Although obsessions in 
obsessive-compulsive disorder may be health-related, when these occur, they tend to be focused 
more on potential contamination than on the undiagnosed symptoms of a particular illness, and 
to be accompanied by a history of other obsessions that are not health-related.
Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviours occur in other obsessive-compulsive and related 
disorders, but the foci of apprehension and form of repetitive behaviours are distinct for each 
diagnostic entity. In body dysmorphic disorder, the intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviours 
are limited to concerns about physical appearance. In trichotillomania or excoriation disorder, 
the repetitive behaviours are limited to hair pulling or skin picking, respectively, in the absence 
of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms include excessive accumulation or difficulty 
discarding possessions and marked distress related to discarding items. Hoarding behaviour 
can be symptomatic of obsessive-compulsive disorder, but in contrast to hoarding disorder it is 
undertaken with the goal of neutralizing or reducing concomitant distress and anxiety arising 
from obsessional content such as aggressive (e.g. fear of harming others), sexual/religious (e.g. 
fear of committing blasphemous or disrespectful acts), contamination (e.g. fear of spreading 
infectious diseases) or symmetry/ordering (e.g. feeling of incompleteness) themes. However, 
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can co-occur, and multiple diagnoses from this 
grouping may be assigned if warranted.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Persistent repetitive thoughts, images or impulses/urges (i.e. obsessions) and/or repetitive 
behaviours (i.e. compulsions) characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder may be difficult to 
distinguish from restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities 
that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder. However, unlike those with autism spectrum 
disorder, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder feel driven to perform repetitive 
behaviours in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, to reduce anxiety or to achieve 
a sense of “completeness”. Obsessive-compulsive disorder can also be distinguished from autism 
spectrum disorder because difficulties in initiating and sustaining social communication and 
reciprocal social interactions are not features of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder
Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) 
presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmic 
movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting). These 
movements are typically less complex than compulsions, and are not aimed at neutralizing 
obsessions.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disorders
Some individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder lack insight about the irrationality of their 
thoughts and behaviours to such an extent that their conviction of the veracity of their obsessions 
– and the strength of beliefs regarding the connection between compulsions and obsessions – 
may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction and fixity with which these 
beliefs are held (see insight specifiers, p. 301). If these beliefs are restricted to fear or conviction 
that intrusive thoughts, images or impulses/urges are true, or that compulsions are realistically 
connected to obsessional content in an individual without a history of other delusions – that 
is, these beliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder and are fully consistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – obsessive-
compulsive disorder should be diagnosed instead of delusional disorder. Individuals with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder do not exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or 
formal thought disorder).
Boundary with depressive disorders
Differentiating rumination that occurs in the context of depressive disorders from obsessions 
and compulsive mental acts characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder is challenging. 
Nonetheless, it may be helpful to consider that ruminations are typically congruent with negative 
affect and reflect depressive cognition (e.g. self-criticism, guilt, failure, regret, pessimism, 
hopelessness). Unlike obsessions, ruminations are not typically experienced as intrusive; nor are 
they linked to compulsive behaviours. In contrast to ruminations, compulsive mental acts are 
typically performed with the intention of reducing distress or perceived risk of harm. Individuals 
with depressive disorders experience low mood or a lack of interest in pleasurable activities, which 
are not diagnostic features of obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder and depressive disorders often co-occur, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full 
diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disorders

Recurrent thoughts, avoidance behaviours and requests for reassurance commonly observed 
in obsessive-compulsive disorder also occur in anxiety and fear-related disorders. In contrast 
to anxiety and fear-related disorders, however, obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder 
are experienced as intrusive, can involve content that is odd or irrational (e.g. intrusive images 
of harming a friend), and are typically accompanied by compulsions. Obsessive-compulsive 
disorder is further differentiated by not being characterized by the same foci of apprehension that 
characterize anxiety and fear-related disorders. For example, in generalized anxiety disorder, the 
recurrent thoughts or worries are focused on negative events that could possibly occur in different 
aspects of everyday life (e.g. work, finances, health, family). In social anxiety disorder, symptoms 
are in response to feared social situations (e.g. speaking in public, initiating a conversation) and 
concerns about being negatively evaluated by others. In specific phobia, symptoms are limited 
to one or a few circumscribed phobic objects or situations (e.g. fear and avoidance of animals), 
and concerns are about the perceived harm that could arise if exposed to these stimuli (e.g. being 
bitten by an animal).
Boundary with panic disorder
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. Some individuals with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder experience panic attacks that are triggered by feared stimuli 
associated with obsessions and compulsions or if the individual is prevented from enacting 
neutralizing compulsions. If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder experiences panic 
attacks exclusively in relation to obsessions or compulsions without the presence of unexpected 
panic attacks, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted. However, if unexpected 
panic attacks are also present and all other diagnostic requirements are met, both diagnoses may 
be assigned.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder
In post-traumatic stress disorder, symptoms are limited to stimuli associated with or that serve 
as reminders of a traumatic event (e.g. fear and avoidance of a place where an individual was 
assaulted) and the intrusive thoughts and images are associated with the traumatic event.
Boundary with eating disorders
Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa 
and binge-eating disorder because obsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about 
being or becoming overweight, and are not accompanied by body-image distortions.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use and impulse control disorders
A variety of behaviours may be described by lay people and sometimes by health professionals as 
“compulsive”, including sexual behaviour, gambling and substance use. Compulsions characteristic 
of obsessive-compulsive disorder are differentiated from these behaviours in that they typically 
lack a rational motivation, and are rarely reported to be pleasurable, although they may reduce 
anxiety or distress. Behaviours such as sexual behaviour, gambling and substance abuse are also 
not typically preceded by intrusive unwanted thoughts characteristic of obsessions, although they 
are often preceded by thoughts about engaging in the relevant behaviour.
Boundary with primary tics and tic disorders including Tourette syndrome
A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, non-rhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g. eye 
blinking, throat clearing). Obsessive-compulsive disorder can be differentiated from tic disorders 
because, unlike compulsions, tics appear unintentional in nature and clearly utilize a discrete 
muscle group. However, it can be difficult to distinguish between complex tics and compulsions 
associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although tics (both complex and simple) are 
preceded by premonitory sensory urges, which diminish as tics occur, tics are not aimed at 
neutralizing antecedent cognitions (e.g. obsessions) or reducing anxiety. Many individuals exhibit 
symptoms of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and primary tic disorders – in particular, 
Tourette syndrome – and both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic requirements for each 
are met.
Boundary with personality disorder with prominent anankastic features
Personality disorder with prominent anankastic features involves an enduring and pervasive 
maladaptive pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. Individuals with personality 
disorder with prominent anankastic features do not experience intrusive thoughts, images, or 
impulses/urges characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder, or engage in repetitive behaviours 
response to these intrusive thoughts. If diagnostic requirements for both obsessive-compulsive 
disorder and a personality disorder with prominent anankastic features are met, both diagnoses 
may be assigned. 
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Obsessive-compulsive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Body dysmorphic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in appearance, or 
ugliness in general, that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others, is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 The presentation is characterized by excessive self-consciousness about the perceived 
defects or flaws, often including ideas of self-reference (the conviction that people are 
taking notice, judging or talking about the perceived defects or flaws).
•	 The preoccupation or self-consciousness is accompanied by any of the following:
•	 repetitive and excessive behaviours, such as repeated examination of the appearance 
or severity of the perceived defects or flaws (e.g. by checking in reflective surfaces) or 
comparison of the relevant features with those of others;
•	 excessive attempts to camouflage or alter the perceived defects or flaws (e.g. specific and 
elaborate forms of dress, undergoing ill-advised cosmetic surgical procedures);
•	 marked avoidance of social or other situations or stimuli that increase distress about the 
perceived defects or flaws (e.g. reflective surfaces, changing rooms, swimming pools).
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and are not due to the 
effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal 
effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Insight specifiers
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder vary in the degree of insight they have about 
the accuracy of the beliefs that underlie their symptoms. Although many can acknowledge 
that their thoughts or behaviours are untrue or excessive, some cannot, and the beliefs of 
some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder may at times appear to be delusional in the 
degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (e.g. an individual is convinced 
that others think they are hideously ugly). Insight may vary substantially even over short 
periods of time – for example, depending on the level of current anxiety or distress – and 
should be assessed with respect to a time period that is sufficient to allow for such fluctuation 
(e.g. a few days or a week). The degree of insight that an individual exhibits in the context of 
body dysmorphic disorder can be specified as follows.
6B21
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Body dysmorphic disorder with fair to good insight
•	 Much of the time, the individual is able to entertain the possibility that their disorder-
specific beliefs may not be true, and they are willing to accept an alternative explanation 
for their experience. This specifier level may still be applied if, at circumscribed times (e.g. 
when highly anxious), the individual demonstrates no insight.
Body dysmorphic disorder with poor to absent insight
•	 Most or all of the time, the individual is convinced that the disorder-specific beliefs are 
true, and they cannot accept an alternative explanation for their experience. The lack of 
insight exhibited by the individual does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.
Body dysmorphic disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Any part of the body may be the focus of the perceived flaws or defects, but the most 
common area is the face (especially the skin, nose, hair, eyes, teeth, lips, chin or overall facial 
appearance). However, there are frequently multiple perceived defects. Usually, the focal 
feature is regarded as flawed, defective, asymmetrical, too big/small or disproportionate, 
or the complaint may be of thinning hair, acne, wrinkles, scars, vascular markings, pallor 
or ruddiness of complexion, or insufficient muscularity. Sometimes the preoccupation is 
vague or consists of a general perception of ugliness or being “not right” or being too 
masculine/feminine.
•	 Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder, can place affected individuals – 
usually males – at increased risk of complications requiring medical attention (e.g. muscle 
tears, strains, side-effects of steroid use).
•	 The risk of suicide in adolescents and adults with body dysmorphic disorder is high, 
particularly when depressive symptomatology co-occurs. Owing to the low base 
rate occurrence of attempted and completed suicide, it is difficult to predict suicidal 
behaviours. Factors to consider in assessing risk include previous attempts, lack of 
perceived psychosocial support, perception of burdensomeness and hopelessness. It 
is also important to consider that identification of body dysmorphic disorder may be 
especially challenging because the increased occurrence of shame and perceived stigma 
among affected individuals often leads them to conceal their difficulties, or to present 
with symptoms of depressive disorders, social anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive 
disorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder.
•	 The diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder is typically made based on direct observation 
or physical examination of the perceived body flaws or defects. If this is not possible 
because it is inappropriate, or the individual refuses to remove their camouflage, then it 
may be difficult to make a judgement about how noticeable or abnormal a perceived defect 
6B21.0

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

is. In such cases, corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informant 
or physician who has conducted a physical examination of the individual.
•	 In some cases, individuals may be persistently preoccupied with one or more perceived 
defects or flaws in appearance, or ugliness in general, of another person – generally a child 
or a romantic partner – that is either unnoticeable or only slightly noticeable to others. 
This phenomenon is often referred to as “body dysmorphic disorder by proxy”. If the 
other diagnostic requirements for the disorder are met with reference to the perceived 
bodily flaws or defects of the other person (e.g. excessive self-consciousness, repetitive 
and excessive examination or checking, marked camouflaging or alteration of the 
perceived defect, avoidance of relevant social situations or triggers, distress or functional 
impairment), a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder may be assigned to the individual 
experiencing the preoccupation.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Body-image concerns are common in many cultures, especially during adolescence. Body 
dysmorphic disorder is differentiated from body dissatisfaction or body-image concerns 
by the degree of preoccupation and frequency of related recurrent behaviours performed, 
as well as the degree of distress or interference the individual experiences as a consequence 
of these symptoms.
Course features
•	 The onset of body dysmorphic disorder commonly occurs during adolescence, with two 
thirds of individuals reporting onset before the age of 18 years. Subclinical symptoms may 
appear during early adolescence (at 12 or 13 years of age).
•	 Although the typical course of body dysmorphic disorder involves a gradual worsening 
of symptoms from subclinical to full symptomatic presentation, some individuals may 
experience an acute onset of symptoms.
•	 Among individuals with onset before the age of 18 years, body dysmorphic disorder is 
associated with gradual onset of symptoms and co-occurring disorders. These individuals 
are also at greater risk of attempting suicide.
•	 Body dysmorphic disorder is generally considered a chronic disorder.
Developmental presentations
•	 Notwithstanding a relatively early age of onset of body dysmorphic disorder, it typically 
takes 10–15 years before affected individuals seek help. New onset may occur among older 
adults, although research with this age group is very limited.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
•	 Onset of body dysmorphic disorder symptoms tends to be gradual. The disorder is 
recurrent, chronic and likely to persist without intervention.
•	 Prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder among adolescents is estimated at approximately 
2%, with higher prevalence among females. Prevalence rates are likely an underestimate 
because shame, embarrassment and stigma about symptoms frequently interfere with 
help-seeking behaviours.
•	 Symptom presentation is similar across all age groups. However, differentiating between 
normality and body dysmorphic disorder in adolescence may be complicated by the 
emergence of developmentally normative concerns about body image that occur during 
this stage.
•	 The course and severity of the disorder tends to be worse among individuals with an 
earlier onset (prior to the age of 18 years). Specifically, these individuals are at increased 
risk of suicide, present with more co-occurring mental disorders, have poorer insight, 
and are more likely to have experienced a gradual progression of symptom onset than 
individuals who develop body dysmorphic disorder in adulthood. Young people with body 
dysmorphic disorder are also at increased risk of school dropout, potentially affecting their 
academic and social development.
Culture-related features
•	 The symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder are similar across cultures, but specific 
concerns are shaped by cultural standards regarding what is considered attractive, 
acceptable, normal or desired. For example, populations in East Asia might be focused 
on epicanthal folds, and concerns about skin colour may be associated with racialized 
conceptions of desirable body characteristics.
•	 Within more collectivistic cultures, or cultures that emphasize shame, the nature of 
the concern about bodily deformities may be focused on anxiety about causing offence 
to others.
•	 Some cultural concepts of distress focus on perceptions of abnormal bodily features and 
may shape the symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder. For example, the shubo-kyofu (“fear 
of a deformed body”) subtype of taijin kyofusho has been reported primarily in Japan; it 
is characterized by intense fear of offending, embarrassing or hurting others through the 
person’s appearance, which is perceived as deformed. Insight is typically poor to absent.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although prevalence rates are similar for both genders, differences in presentation have 
been described. Women are more likely to experience co-occurring eating disorders, 
whereas men are more likely to be concerned with the appearance of their genitalia and 
their overall physique (i.e. muscle dysmorphia).
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
Hypochondriasis is characterized by persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility of 
having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses, whereas in body dysmorphic 
disorder the preoccupation is with perceived flaws or defects in the individual’s appearance.
Boundary with trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) 
disorder
Hair pulling and skin picking can occur as symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder when there is 
a preoccupation with the skin or hair appearing defective and the intended aim is to improve its 
appearance. In contrast, when the behaviour is a body-focused repetitive behaviour with no clear 
relationship to a perceived defect on the skin or hair, then it is better classified as trichotillomania 
or excoriation disorder.
Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviours occur in other obsessive-compulsive and related 
disorders, but the foci of apprehension and form of repetitive behaviours are distinct for each 
diagnostic entity. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the intrusive thoughts and repetitive 
behaviours are not limited to concerns about appearance but rather encompass a variety of 
obsessions (e.g. of contamination, of causing harm) and compulsions (e.g. excessive washing, 
counting, checking) intended to neutralize these obsessions. In olfactory reference disorder 
individuals are preoccupied exclusively with emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odour. 
However, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can co-occur, and multiple diagnoses from 
this grouping may be assigned if warranted.
Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disorders
Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder lack insight about the irrationality of their 
thoughts and behaviours to such an extent that convictions that their appearance is flawed may at 
times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held 
(see insight specifiers, p. 308). If these beliefs are restricted to the fear or conviction of having a 
flawed appearance or bodily defect in an individual without a history of other delusions – that is, 
these beliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of body dysmorphic disorder 
and are fully consistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – body dysmorphic disorder 
should be diagnosed instead of delusional disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder 
do not exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).
Boundary with mood disorders
Individuals experiencing a depressive episode with psychotic symptoms may occasionally 
become preoccupied with perceived physical flaws or defects, which can be differentiated from 
body dysmorphic disorder on the basis of the absence of such symptoms outside of the mood 
episode. However, individuals with a history of body dysmorphic disorder commonly experience 
co-occurring depressive symptoms as a consequence of the distress and impairment of their body 
dysmorphic disorder symptoms. If depressive symptoms consistent with a mood disorder are 
present in an individual with body dysmorphic disorder, both disorders may be diagnosed.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
In generalized anxiety disorder, recurrent thoughts or worries are focused on potential negative 
outcomes that might occur in a variety of everyday aspects of life (e.g. family, finances, work). 
Although some individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may worry excessively about 
their appearance, these preoccupations occur together with worries about other aspects of life, 
are rarely delusional, and are not typically accompanied by the recurrent checking behaviour 
associated with body dysmorphic disorder.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
In social anxiety disorder, symptoms are in response to feared social situations, and the primary 
concern is about the person’s own behaviour or manifestations of anxiety (e.g. fear they may 
blush) being negatively evaluated by others. In contrast, individuals with body dysmorphic 
disorder believe their appearance or a specific feature of their appearance (e.g. belief that skin 
appears permanently red) looks flawed. Some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder 
experience significant anxiety in social situations, and fear they will be seen as ugly and therefore 
be rejected. If their concerns are broader than the exclusive focus on their perceived flaws or 
defects in appearance, and other symptoms of social anxiety disorder are present, both conditions 
may be diagnosed.
Boundary with eating disorders
Body dysmorphic disorder can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and 
binge-eating disorder because preoccupations in body dysmorphic disorder are not limited to 
body-image concerns (i.e. idealized low body weight). Rather, the preoccupations can encompass 
a variety of idealized aspects of appearance. Some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder 
exhibit muscle dysmorphia such that they are preoccupied about being insufficiently muscular or 
lean and, in response, may exhibit unusual eating behaviours (e.g. excessive protein consumption) 
or engage in excessive exercise (e.g. weight lifting). In these cases, behaviours related to diet and 
exercise are motivated by a desire to be more muscular rather than to attain or maintain a low 
body weight. However, if low body weight idealization is central to the clinical presentation, 
and all other diagnostic requirements are met, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa instead of body 
dysmorphic disorder should be assigned.
Boundary with body integrity dysphoria
The persistent preoccupation and excessive self-consciousness experienced by individuals with 
body dysmorphic disorder derives from their concerns that an aspect of their body or appearance 
is perceived by others to be ugly or deformed. In contrast, the persistent discomfort or intense 
negative feelings about a particular body part (most commonly one or both arms or legs) 
experienced by individuals with the rare condition of body integrity dysphoria derives from their 
sense that a part of their body is alien, or that the way their body is configured is wrong or 
unnatural. This leads to a desire to amputate or be rid of the particular body part rather than 
wishing to improve its appearance.
Boundary with gender incongruence of adolescence and adulthood and gender 
incongruence of childhood
Gender incongruence of adolescence and adulthood and gender incongruence of childhood 
differ from body dysmorphic disorder in that in these conditions the preoccupation with aspects 
of bodily appearance centres exclusively on the individual’s experience of a marked incongruence 
between their expressed or experienced gender and their biological sex. A common consequence 
is that individuals will clearly state a desire to alter their primary and secondary sex characteristics 
such that they align with their experienced gender.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body dysmorphic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Olfactory reference disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent preoccupation about emitting a foul or offensive body odour or breath (i.e. 
halitosis) that is either unnoticeable or slightly noticeable to others such that the individual’s 
concerns are markedly disproportionate to the smell – if any is perceptible – is required 
for diagnosis.
•	 The presentation is characterized by excessive self-consciousness about the perceived 
odour, often including ideas of self-reference (i.e. the conviction that people are taking 
notice of, judging or talking about the odour).
•	 The preoccupation or self-consciousness is accompanied by any of the following:
•	 repetitive and excessive behaviours, such as repeatedly checking for body odour 
or checking the perceived source of the smell (e.g. clothing), or repeatedly seeking 
reassurance;
•	 excessive attempts to camouflage, alter or prevent the perceived odour (e.g. using perfume 
or deodorant, repetitive bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothing, avoidance of certain 
foods);
•	 marked avoidance of social or other situations or stimuli that increase distress about the 
perceived foul or offensive odour (e.g. public transportation or other situations of close 
proximity to other people).
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and are not due to the 
effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal 
effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Insight specifiers
Individuals with olfactory reference disorder vary in the degree of insight they have about the

their thoughts or behaviours are untrue or excessive, some cannot, and the beliefs of some 
individuals with olfactory reference disorder may at times appear to be delusional in the 
degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (e.g. an individual is convinced 
that they are emitting a foul odour). Insight may vary substantially even over short periods

Olfactory reference disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 The diagnosis of olfactory reference disorder partly depends on determining whether 
there is evidence of the odour reported by the individual. A variety of other medical and 
dental conditions can be associated with unpleasant odours (e.g. periodontal disease, 
trimethylaminuria), and these underlying causes should be ruled out, particularly if the 
odour is detectable even if slight. However, the perceived odour may vary in intensity, 
or the individual may be unable or unwilling to remove camouflaging odours (e.g. 
perfume), which may make it difficult to judge how noticeable the odour is. In such cases, 
corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informant or physician 
who has conducted a physical examination of the individual.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Fear of emitting offensive odours is, to some extent, common in many cultures. However, 
olfactory reference disorder can be differentiated from normal concerns by the degree 
of preoccupation and frequency of related recurrent behaviours performed, as well 
as the degree of distress or interference the individual experiences as a consequence of 
these symptoms.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Olfactory reference disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
•	 Onset of olfactory reference disorder is most often reported as occurring during the mid-
20s; however, onset during puberty or adolescence is also common.
•	 Olfactory reference disorder is generally considered a chronic and persistent disorder, with 
potential worsening over time.
•	 Embarrassment and shame, in conjunction with limited insight and false beliefs that may 
be delusional in intensity, may lead to underreporting of concerns related to perceived 
body odour in clinical settings.
•	 Individuals with olfactory reference disorders often consult non-mental health services on 
multiple occasions (e.g. medical, surgical, dental specialists) about their perceived odour 
prior to receiving a diagnosis.
Culture-related features
•	 Within more collectivistic cultures, or cultures that emphasize shame, the nature of the 
concern about bodily odour may be focused around fears of causing offence to others.
•	 Cultural concepts related to olfactory reference disorder include taijin kyofusho in Japan 
and related conditions in the Republic of Korea and other societies. They are characterized 
by intense fear of offending, embarrassing or hurting others through improper or awkward 
social behaviour, movements or appearance. If the concerns focus specifically on body 
odour, olfactory reference disorder is the appropriate ICD-11 diagnosis. In these cases, 
insight is typically poor to absent.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviours occur in obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, 
in olfactory reference disorder, the intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviours are limited to 
concerns about body or breath odour. If obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours are not 
restricted to concerns about emitting a smell, both disorders can be diagnosed.
Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disorders
Many individuals with olfactory reference disorder lack insight about the irrationality of their 
thoughts and behaviours to such an extent that convictions that they are emitting a foul odour 
may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs 
are held (see insight specifiers, p. 314). If these beliefs are restricted to the fear or conviction of 
emitting a foul odour in an individual without a history of other delusions – that is, these beliefs 
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Olfactory reference disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of olfactory reference disorder and are fully 
consistent with the other clinical features or the disorder – olfactory reference disorder should 
be diagnosed instead of delusional disorder. Individuals with olfactory reference disorder do not 
exhibit other features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).
Boundary with mood disorders
In depressive disorders with psychotic symptoms, somatic delusions related to a perceived odour 
can occur (e.g. that their flesh is rotting and smells fetid), but typically these are an integral part 
of a range of preoccupations or delusions (e.g. related to guilt, nihilism, poverty) and occur 
alongside other depressive symptoms (e.g. loss of interest in pleasurable activities, suicidality, 
sleep disturbances and weight loss or gain). However, both disorders may co-occur, and both 
diagnoses may be assigned if warranted.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
Individuals with olfactory reference disorder may avoid social situations specifically because they 
believe they are emitting a foul odour. In contrast, in social anxiety disorder, social situations are 
avoided because the individual is concerned that they will act in a way, or show anxiety symptoms, 
that will be negatively evaluated by others (i.e. be humiliating, be embarrassing, lead to rejection 
or be offensive).
Hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility of having one or more serious, 
progressive or life-threatening illnesses is required for diagnosis.
•	 The preoccupation is accompanied by either:
•	 repetitive and excessive health-related behaviours, such as repeatedly checking of the body 
for evidence of illness, spending inordinate amounts of time searching for information 
about the feared illness or repeatedly seeking reassurance (e.g. arranging multiple medical 
consultations); or
•	 maladaptive avoidance behaviour related to health (e.g. avoiding medical appointments).
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.

Insight specifiers
Individuals with hypochondriasis vary in the degree of insight they have about the accuracy 
of the beliefs that underlie their health concerns. Although many can acknowledge that 
their thoughts or behaviours are untrue or excessive, some cannot, and the beliefs of a small 
minority of individuals with hypochondriasis may at times appear to be delusional in the 
degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (e.g. an individual is convinced 
that they have a terminal illness). Insight may vary substantially even over short periods of 
time – for example, depending on the level of current anxiety or distress – and should be 
assessed with respect to a time period that is sufficient to allow for such fluctuation (e.g. 
a few days or a week). The degree of insight that an individual exhibits in the context of 
hypochondriasis can be specified as follows.
Hypochondriasis with fair to good insight
•	 Much of the time, the individual is able to entertain the possibility that their disorder-
specific beliefs may not be true, and they are willing to accept an alternative explanation 
for their experience. This specifier level may still be applied if, at circumscribed times (e.g. 
when highly anxious), the individual demonstrates no insight.
Hypochondriasis with poor to absent insight
•	 Most or all of the time, the individual is convinced that the disorder-specific beliefs are 
true, and they cannot accept an alternative explanation for their experience. The lack of 
insight exhibited by the individual does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.
Hypochondriasis, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Individuals with hypochondriasis often make catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily 
signs or symptoms, including normal or commonplace sensations (e.g. worrying that a 
tension headache is indicative of a brain tumour).
•	 Individuals with hypochondriasis typically have a high level of anxiety about health, are 
often hypervigilant of bodily sensations and symptoms, and may become easily alarmed 
about their personal health status, to the extent that the experience of anxiety – including 
panic attacks – may be a significant presenting feature. For this reason, health anxiety 
disorder is included as an alternative name for the disorder.

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
•	 Individuals with hypochondriasis may undergo repeated, unnecessary medical 
examinations and diagnostic tests, with deterioration of the clinician-individual 
relationship, and frequent “doctor-shopping”. They may also spend excessive time searching 
health and medical sites on the internet.
•	 Conversely, individuals with hypochondriasis may respond to their anxiety about their 
health by avoiding contact with reminders of health status, including medical check-ups, 
health facilities and health-related information.
•	 Individuals with hypochondriasis may become alarmed about their health when someone 
they know becomes sick, when they read or hear about illness, or in response to life 
stressors. The preoccupation is often a central topic of their conversation with others.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The preoccupation is not simply a reasonable concern related to a circumscribed situation 
(e.g. awaiting results of testing for a serious illness), and persists or reoccurs despite 
appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance.
•	 If a chronic or acute medical condition is present, or the individual is at high risk of 
developing a medical condition (e.g. due to high genetic risk, a recent exposure to a 
communicable disease), preoccupations related to such conditions are common, and 
a high threshold should be used for a diagnosis of hypochondriasis. The diagnosis of 
hypochondriasis should only be made if the degree of preoccupation and repetitive health-
related behaviours or avoidance are clearly excessive and disproportionate.
•	 Health-related anxiety is common among older adults. New onset of health concerns 
in later life may reflect normal age-related concerns or, if excessive and impairing, the 
presence of a depressive disorder rather than hypochondriasis.
Course features
•	 Hypochondriasis is generally considered to be a chronic and relapsing condition leading 
to significant impairment.
•	 Individuals with hypochondriasis are much more likely to seek medical services for somatic 
rather than mental health reasons, which often contributes to health-related anxiety due to 
the wait for diagnostic testing or the belief that their concerns are not being taken seriously.
Developmental presentations
•	 Hypochondriasis tends to have its onset in early to mid-adulthood. Identification is often 
delayed because patients seek multiple consultations with health-care providers, focusing 
on having a serious physical illness.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Hypochondriasis is thought to be rare in childhood and adolescence. However, fears 
and beliefs focusing on health may emerge in early childhood, with significant levels 
of symptoms persisting throughout childhood, potentially contributing to diagnostic 
requirements being met in adulthood.
•	 Hypochondriasis is common among older adults – although often underdiagnosed 
– with symptoms frequently focusing on memory loss. Clinicians may fail to identify 
hypochondriasis due to the presence of comorbid medical conditions that emerge with 
ageing and/or co-occurrence with depressive symptoms that overshadow hypochondriacal 
concerns. Preoccupations with bodily concerns increases with age such that determining 
the degree to which these concerns are manifestations of depressive symptoms, physical 
conditions, an accurate reflection of declining bodily functioning, or hypochondriasis is 
challenging.
•	 Among younger children, differential diagnosis between hypochondriasis and obsessive-
compulsive disorder is particularly challenging because health concerns can be prominent 
features of both disorders. Children may not be able to articulate the content of their fears 
or the focus of their apprehension, making it difficult to assess the difference between 
symptoms of hypochondriasis and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Culture-related features
•	 In hypochondriasis, the focus of illness belief or conviction may be influenced by cultural 
beliefs about how the illness might have been acquired. For example, in some cultures, 
hypochondriasis might arise as a result of perceived failure to follow prescribed cultural 
practices or rituals, or as the effect of a curse, witchcraft or sorcery.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with body dysmorphic disorder
Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by persistent preoccupation with perceived flaws or 
defects in the individual’s appearance, whereas in hypochondriasis the preoccupation is about the 
possibility of having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses.
Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviours occur in other obsessive-compulsive and related 
disorders, but the foci of apprehension and form of repetitive behaviours are distinct for each 
diagnostic entity. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the intrusive thoughts and repetitive 
behaviours are not limited to concerns about health but rather encompass a variety of obsessions 
(e.g. of contamination, of causing harm) and compulsions (e.g. excessive washing, counting, 
checking) intended to neutralize these obsessions. In body dysmorphic disorder, the preoccupation 
is with perceived flaws in appearance or physical features, whereas in olfactory reference disorder, 
individuals are preoccupied exclusively with emitting a perceived foul or offensive body odour. 
However, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can co-occur, and multiple diagnoses from 
this grouping may be assigned if warranted.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disorders
Some individuals with hypochondriasis lack insight about the irrationality of their thoughts and 
behaviours to such an extent that convictions of having a medical illness may at times appear to 
be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (see insight 
specifiers, p. 318). If these beliefs are restricted to the fear or conviction of having a disease in 
an individual without a history of other delusions – that is, these beliefs occur entirely in the 
context of symptomatic episodes of hypochondriasis and are fully consistent with the other 
clinical features of the disorder – hypochondriasis should be diagnosed instead of delusional 
disorder. Somatic delusions characteristic of some presentations of delusional disorder tend to be 
less medically plausible (e.g. that an organ is rotting), and are generally not focused on the belief 
that the individual has a specific disease. Individuals with hypochondriasis do not exhibit other 
features of psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).
Boundary with depressive disorders
In depressive disorders, hypochondriacal preoccupations or somatic delusions can occur, but 
typically they are an integral part of a range of preoccupations or delusions (e.g. related to 
guilt, nihilism, poverty) and occur alongside other depressive symptoms (e.g. loss of interest in 
pleasurable activities, suicidality, sleep disturbances and weight loss or gain).
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may have worries about their health, but they also 
harbour a range of other worries focused on negative events that could occur in several different 
aspects of everyday life (e.g. work, finances, health, family). Unlike in hypochondriasis, there is 
typically not a persistent preoccupation with illness that persists despite medical evaluation and 
reassurance.
Boundary with panic disorder
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. Individuals with panic 
disorder often worry that the somatic symptoms they experience during panic attacks are 
evidence of serious medical condition (e.g. a heart attack or a stroke). An additional diagnosis 
of hypochondriasis should not be assigned on that basis. Conversely, if an individual with 
hypochondriasis experiences panic attacks exclusively in response to preoccupation or fear 
about the possibility of having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses, 
an additional diagnosis of panic disorder is not warranted. However, if both unexpected panic 
attacks and persistent preoccupation or fear about the possibility of having one or more serious, 
progressive or life-threatening illnesses are present and all other diagnostic requirements are met, 
both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with bodily distress disorder
Bodily distress disorder is characterized by the presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing 
to the individual and to which excessive attention is directed, such as dwelling on the severity 
of the symptoms and repeatedly visiting health-care providers. While some individuals with 
hypochondriasis may experience bodily symptoms that cause distress and for which they may 
seek medical attention, their main concern in doing so is the fear that the symptoms are indicative 
of having a serious, progressive or life-threatening illness. In contrast, individuals with bodily 
distress disorder are typically preoccupied with the bodily symptoms themselves and the impact 
they have on their lives, and while they may seek out health-care providers who can determine the 
cause of their symptoms, they do so in order to get relief from the symptoms, not to disconfirm 
the belief that they have a serious medical illness.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Hoarding disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Accumulation of possessions that results in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point 
that their use or safety is compromised is required for diagnosis. Note: if living areas are 
uncluttered, this is only due to the intervention of third parties (e.g. family members, 
cleaners, authorities). Accumulation occurs due to both:
•	 repetitive urges or behaviours related to amassing items, which may be passive 
(e.g. accumulation of incoming flyers or mail) or active (e.g. excessive acquisition of 
free, purchased or stolen items); and
•	 difficulty discarding possessions due to a perceived need to save items, and distress 
associated with discarding them.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Insight specifiers
Individuals with hoarding disorder vary in the degree to which they recognize that hoarding-
related beliefs and behaviours (pertaining to excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, or 
clutter) are problematic. For example, some can acknowledge that their living space presents a 
hazard, that many of the items they save are without value and unlikely to be of future use, or 
that their distress associated with discarding items is not rational. Others are convinced that their 
hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours are not problematic, despite evidence to the contrary, 
and the beliefs of some may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of conviction or fixity 
with which these beliefs are held (e.g. an individual insists that items that objectively have little 
or no value are critically important to save, or denies that there is any problem with their living 
space). Insight may vary substantially even over short periods of time – for example, depending 
on the level of current anxiety or distress – such as when a family member or other person forces 
the individual to discard items. The degree of insight that an individual exhibits in the context of 
hoarding disorder can be specified as follows.
Hoarding disorder with fair to good insight
•	 Much of the time, the individual recognizes that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviours 
(pertaining to excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, or clutter) are problematic. This 
specifier level may still be applied if, at circumscribed times (e.g. when being forced to 
discard items), the individual demonstrates no insight.

Hoarding disorder with poor to absent insight
•	 Most or all of the time, the individual is convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and 
behaviours (pertaining to excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, or clutter) are not 
problematic, despite evidence to the contrary. The lack of insight exhibited by the individual 
does not vary markedly as a function of anxiety level.
Hoarding disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Assessment for the diagnosis of hoarding disorder may require obtaining additional 
information beyond self-report, such as reports from collateral informants or visual 
inspection of clutter in the home.
•	 Generally, items are hoarded because of their emotional significance (e.g. association with 
a significant event, person, place or time), instrumental characteristics (e.g. perceived 
usefulness) or intrinsic value (e.g. perceived aesthetic qualities).
•	 Individuals with hoarding disorder may be unable to find important items (e.g. bills, 
tax forms), circulate easily inside their home, or even exit their home in the event of an 
emergency. Ability to prepare food, use sinks or home appliances (e.g. refrigerator, stove, 
washing machine) or furniture (e.g. sofas, chairs, beds, tables) may also be compromised.
•	 Individuals with hoarding disorder may experience a range of chronic medical problems, 
such as obesity, and are exposed to various environmental risks often caused by their 
hoarding behaviour, including fire hazards, injuries from falling, contamination by rotting 
perishable foods, and allergies from contact with dust pollen and bacteria.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Collectors acquire many items that they report being attached to and are reluctant to 
discard. However, they are also more targeted in their acquisitions (e.g. confining their 
acquisitions to a narrow range of items), more selective (e.g. planning and purchasing 
only predetermined items), more likely to organize their possessions, and less likely to 
accumulate items in an excessive manner.
6B24.1
6B24.Z
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
•	 Hoarding behaviours often begin during childhood or adolescence, and persist into later 
life. Onset after the age of 40 years is rare.
•	 Hoarding disorder is typically chronic and progressive.
•	 The consequences of hoarding typically become more severe and impairing with age, owing 
to accumulation of objects over time and an increasing inability to discard or organize 
possessions. Sometimes, this is due to the onset of comorbid medical conditions and co-
occurring mental disorders.
•	 Among older adults, hoarding disorder is associated with impairment in a range of life 
domains, including unsafe living conditions, social isolation, pathological self-neglect (i.e. 
poor hygiene), co-occurring mental disorders and medical comorbidities.
Developmental presentations
•	 Hoarding disorder has its onset in childhood and adolescence (between the ages of 11 
and 15 years) with prevalence rates reported as high as 2–3.7% by mid-adolescence. Later 
life onset may be a manifestation of the cognitive deficits and behavioural symptoms 
associated with dementia (e.g. decreased inhibition or repetitive behaviour) rather than 
hoarding disorder.
•	 Excessive collecting and accumulation of clutter characteristic of hoarding disorder in 
adults may not be as evident among young people because caregivers may restrict excessive 
acquisition of objects. As such, hoarding is more likely to be restricted to particular areas 
(such as a child’s bedroom) and types of materials (such as school-related objects, toys and 
food) that the child can most easily access.
•	 Collecting and saving items is developmentally appropriate behaviour for young children 
up to the age of 6 years, making it more challenging for parents and clinicians to differentiate 
problematic hoarding from age-appropriate collecting and retaining objects.
•	 Individuals with hoarding disorder are more likely to experience co-occurring mental 
disorders or comorbid medical conditions, though this varies across developmental 
periods. Children and adolescents with hoarding symptoms are more likely to have co-
occurring mental disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder. Hoarding symptoms are also more common among young people 
with autism spectrum disorder or Prader-Willi syndrome. However, an additional 
diagnosis of hoarding disorder may be appropriate if the symptoms of each disorder require 
independent clinical attention. Among older adults with hoarding disorder, depressive 
disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder are the 
most common co-occurring mental disorders.
•	 Hoarding occurring later in life has also been correlated with decreased memory, attention 
and executive functioning, although the increased rates of co-occurring disorders such as 
dementia and depressive disorders may also be involved.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Culture-related features
•	 The nature of what is collected and the meaning, emotional valence and value that people 
with hoarding disorder assign to their possessions may have cultural significance.
•	 Cultural values of thriftiness and accumulation should not be mistaken as evidence of 
disorder. In some cultural environments, saving items for later use is encouraged. This 
may be especially true in contexts of scarcity or within groups who have experienced 
protracted periods of scarcity. Unless the symptoms are beyond what is expected of the 
cultural norms, these behaviours should not be assigned a diagnosis of hoarding disorder.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although prevalence rates for hoarding disorder are higher among women in clinical 
samples, some epidemiological studies have reported significantly higher prevalence rates 
among men.
•	 Men with hoarding disorder are more likely to have co-occurring obsessive-compulsive 
disorder.
•	 Although the presenting features of hoarding disorder do not vary across genders, women 
tend to exhibit more excessive acquisition, particularly by means of compulsive buying.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Individuals affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder may accumulate excessive amounts 
of objects (i.e. compulsive hoarding). However, unlike hoarding disorder, the behaviour is 
undertaken with the goal of neutralizing or reducing concomitant distress and anxiety arising 
from obsessional content such as aggressive (e.g. fear of harming others), sexual/religious (e.g. 
fear of committing blasphemous or disrespectful acts), contamination (e.g. fear of spreading 
infectious diseases) or symmetry/ordering (e.g. feeling of incompleteness) themes. Furthermore, 
even in individuals affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder who have poor or absent insight, 
the behaviour is generally unwanted and distressing, whereas in hoarding disorder it may be 
associated with pleasure or enjoyment. However, both diagnoses may be assigned if the diagnostic 
requirements for each are met.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by restricted interests that may result in object 
accumulation, and may also result in difficulty discarding objects due to distress associated 
with changes imposed on a familiar environment. However, individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder display other symptoms that are typically lacking among individuals with hoarding 
disorder, including persistent deficits in social communication and reciprocal social interactions.
Boundary with delusional disorder and other primary psychotic disorders
In schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, object accumulation may occur but 
is typically driven by delusions. Some individuals with hoarding disorder lack insight about 
the irrationality of their thoughts and behaviours to such an extent that convictions of the 
importance of acquiring and retaining items may at times appear to be delusional in the degree of 
conviction or fixity with which these beliefs are held (see insight specifiers, p. 322). If these beliefs 
are restricted to the fear of discarding items or conviction that items have a special importance 
despite objective evidence to the contrary without a history of other delusions – that is, these 
beliefs occur entirely in the context of symptomatic episodes of hoarding disorder and are fully 
consistent with the other clinical features of the disorder – hoarding disorder should be diagnosed 
instead of delusional disorder. Individuals with hoarding disorder do not exhibit other features of 
psychosis (e.g. hallucinations or formal thought disorder).
Boundary with mood disorders
Unlike individuals with hoarding disorder, those with mood disorders may exhibit hoarding 
secondary to depressive or manic symptomatology. In the case of depressive disorders, 
decreased energy, lack of initiative or apathy may lead to object accumulation, which – unlike 
hoarding disorder – is done without any intention or purpose. Furthermore, individuals with 
depressive disorders may be indifferent to hoarding objects, and display no distress associated 
with discarding them. In the case of bipolar disorders, object accumulation may be secondary to 
excessive buying that can occur during manic episodes. However, those with bipolar disorders do 
not have difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, and only very rarely are manic episodes 
of sufficient duration to allow for a substantial amount of clutter to develop in the home.
Boundary with feeding and eating disorders
Some individuals diagnosed with feeding and eating disorders may accumulate large quantities 
of food to allow for binge eating in specific situations (e.g. while at home alone). However, in 
contrast to hoarding disorder, the purpose of accumulation is restricted to the consumption of 
food. Concerns about being or becoming overweight and body-image distortions are not present 
in hoarding disorder.
Boundary with dementia
Some individuals with dementia accumulate objects as a result of progressive neurocognitive 
deficit. Unlike hoarding disorder, individuals with dementia display little interest in accumulating 
objects or distress associated with discarding items. Furthermore, collecting behaviour in 
dementia may be accompanied by severe personality and behavioural changes, such as apathy, 
sexual indiscretions and motor stereotyped movements.
Boundary with Prader-Willi syndrome
Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with an increased drive to eat and a range of compulsive 
symptoms, including food storing. The presence of short stature, hypogonadism, failure to thrive, 
hypotonia and a history of feeding difficulty in the neonatal period are helpful for the differential 
diagnosis with hoarding disorder.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Hoarding disorder

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders
Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders are characterized by recurrent and habitual actions 
directed at the integument (e.g. hair pulling, skin picking, lip biting), typically accompanied by 
unsuccessful attempts to decrease or stop the behaviour involved, and which lead to dermatological 
sequelae (e.g. hair loss, skin lesions, lip abrasions). The behaviour may occur in brief episodes 
scattered throughout the day or in less frequent but more sustained periods.
General cultural considerations for body-focused repetitive 
behaviour disorders
•	 People who may inflict bodily harm to themselves (e.g. self-flagellation or self-cutting) as 
a part of religious ceremonies should not be assigned this diagnosis.
Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder)
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by:
•	 recurrent pulling of the individual’s hair;
•	 unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease hair pulling;
•	 significant hair loss results from pulling behaviour.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Additional clinical features
•	 Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body where hair grows. However, the 
most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows and eyelids. Less frequently reported sites are 
axillary, facial, pubic and peri-rectal regions. Patterns of hair loss are variable, with some 
areas of complete alopecia and others with thinning hair density.
•	 Individuals with trichotillomania may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i.e. pulling 
single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternately, 
individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g. by using makeup, scarves 
or wigs).
6B25
6B25.0
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The diagnosis of trichotillomania is typically made based on direct observation or physical 
examination of the hair loss. If this is not possible (e.g. because of religious proscriptions), 
then it may be difficult to make a judgement about the extent of hair loss. In such cases, 
corroborative evidence may be required from a knowledgeable informant or physician 
who has conducted a physical examination of the individual.
•	 Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or in less frequent 
but more sustained periods that can continue for hours. Hair pulling may endure for 
months or years before coming to clinical attention.
•	 Trichotillomania often presents with rituals surrounding hair such as visually or tactilely 
examining the hair or orally manipulating the hair after it has been pulled. Individuals 
who commonly swallow or eat the hair that has been pulled (trichophagia) can experience 
serious and even life-threatening gastrointestinal symptoms, depending on the volume of 
hair consumed.
•	 Focused hair pulling often increases during periods of increased psychological distress.
•	 Hair-pulling behaviour is associated with a variety of reported effects, including regulation 
of affect and arousal, tension reduction and promotion of pleasure, which presumably 
reinforce these behaviours. However, in the aftermath of hair pulling, many individuals 
report a variety of negative affective states, such as a sense of loss of control or shame. 
Individuals with trichotillomania report varying degrees of awareness of their hair-pulling 
behaviour.
•	 Trichotillomania commonly co-occurs with excoriation disorder, other body-focused 
repetitive behaviours (e.g. nail biting), obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressive disorders, 
and anxiety and fear-related disorders.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Occasional pulling of a grey or out-of-place hair is normal and done by most people at 
some time in their lives. Many individuals also twist and play with their hair, whereas 
others may bite or tear rather than pull their hair; these behaviours do not qualify for 
a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Trichotillomania involves recurrent hair pulling, and is 
associated with significant distress or impairment, which are not present in occasional, 
normal pulling.
Course features
•	 Trichotillomania is generally considered a chronic condition; however, for some individuals, 
symptoms may wax and wane for weeks, months or years at a time without intervention. 
Rates of remission decrease with increasing time since symptom onset.
•	 Patterns of hair-pulling behaviour vary greatly, and individual sites of hair pulling may 
change over time.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of trichotillomania is bimodal, with a peak during early childhood and one during 
early adolescence.
•	 Hair-pulling behaviour in infancy (before 2 years of age) is relatively common, with most 
individuals ceasing to engage in the behaviour by early childhood. However, many adults 
reporting a chronic history of trichotillomania describe early childhood onset. Whether 
onset in early childhood (compared to onset in adolescence) presents as a distinct subtype 
of the disorder, or what factors may contribute to persistence, is therefore unknown.
•	 Onset is most common in early adolescence, coinciding with puberty. Adolescent onset is 
associated with greater chronicity and impairment. Prevalence rates among adolescents 
are similar to those among adults (approximately 1–2% of the general population).
•	 Children and adolescents engage more frequently in automatic hair pulling; that is, they 
engage in the behaviour outside awareness. Focused, intentional hair pulling – often 
preceded by intense urges and followed by relief – is more common among adolescents 
and adults.
•	 The negative impact of hair pulling appears to become more severe across developmental 
periods. Children under the age of 10 years appear to experience less academic impact than 
older children and adolescents, who tend to report more difficulties in school attendance 
and academic performance as a result of hair pulling.
•	 As with adults, children and adolescents with trichotillomania appear to have high rates of 
co-occurring mental health disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, other body-focused repetitive 
behaviour disorders and depressive disorders. Children and adolescents may also be more 
likely to present with co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Prevalence rates appear to be equal among girls and boys in childhood, although female 
adolescents and adults are more commonly diagnosed.
•	 Although there is no evidence for gender differences in course and symptom presentation, 
men are more likely to experience a co-occurring anxiety or fear-related disorder or 
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
•	 Focused hair pulling in women often increases during puberty and at other times of 
hormonal fluctuations during adulthood (e.g. menstruation, perimenopause).
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Repetitive behaviours observed in trichotillomania occur in other obsessive-compulsive and 
related disorders, but these are typically related to specific foci of apprehension, and are associated 
with distinct intent for each diagnostic entity. Individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive 
disorder may engage in hair-pulling behaviour (e.g. as a symmetry ritual meant to “balance” their 
hair). Furthermore, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder often exhibit other symmetry 
rituals alongside identifiable obsessions and compulsions unrelated to hair pulling. Nonetheless, 
co-occurrence with obsessive-compulsive disorder is common, and if both disorders are present, 
both may be diagnosed. Body dysmorphic disorder may be associated with removal of body hair 
that the individual perceives as ugly or as appearing abnormal.
Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder
Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) 
presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmic 
movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting). 
These behaviours rarely include hair-pulling behaviour, but if they do, the behaviour tends to 
be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable. Furthermore, 
stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (i.e. before 2 years of age), 
whereas trichotillomania typically has an onset in early adolescence.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may remove hair in 
response to a delusion or hallucination. An additional diagnosis of trichotillomania should not 
be assigned in such cases.
Boundary with medical conditions classified elsewhere and disorders due to 
substance use
The symptoms of trichotillomania are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. 
inflammation of the hair follicles). Skin biopsy or dermoscopy are able to differentiate individuals 
with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders. Although hair-pulling behaviour 
may be exacerbated by certain substances (e.g. amfetamine), there is no evidence that substances 
can be the primary cause of recurrent hair pulling.
Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by:
•	 recurrent picking of the individual’s skin;
•	 unsuccessful attempts to stop or decrease skin picking;
•	 significant skin lesions resulting from picking behaviour.
6B25.1
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Additional clinical features
•	 Furthermore, excoriation disorder commonly co-occurs with depressive and anxiety 
symptoms, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other body-focused repetitive behaviours 
(e.g. nail biting).
•	 The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms and hands, but many individuals pick 
from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at minor skin irregularities, 
at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs from previous picking. Most individuals 
pick with their fingernails, although a substantial minority use tweezers, knives or other 
objects. The essential features emphasize that skin picking must lead to skin lesions. 
However, individuals with this disorder often attempt to conceal or camouflage evidence 
of skin picking (e.g. using makeup or clothing). Therefore, careful assessment including 
information from collateral sources may be required to ascertain the presence of excoriation 
disorder symptomatology.
•	 Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of time on their 
behaviour – sometimes several hours each day. Skin picking may endure for months or 
years before coming to clinical attention.
•	 Excoriation disorder often presents with rituals surrounding the skin such as visually or 
tactilely examining the skin, orally manipulating or eating the skin or scab after it has been 
picked.
•	 Skin-picking behaviour is associated with a variety of reported effects, including regulation 
of affect and arousal, tension reduction and promotion of pleasure, which presumably 
reinforce these behaviours. However, in the aftermath of skin picking, many individuals 
report a variety of negative affective states, such as a sense of loss of control or shame. 
Individuals with excoriation disorder report varying degrees of awareness of their skin-
picking behaviour.
•	 Excoriation disorder commonly co-occurs with trichotillomania.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Occasional picking of one’s skin (e.g. scabs, cuticles or acne) is normal and done by most 
people at some time in their lives. Some individuals bite their cuticles or surrounding 
skin; these behaviours do not qualify for a diagnosis of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. 
Excoriation disorder involves recurrent picking and is associated with significant distress 
or impairment, which are not present in occasional, normal skin picking.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
•	 Onset of excoriation disorder can occur at any age, but most often coincides with onset or 
shortly after onset of puberty.
•	 The onset commonly occurs in association with a dermatological condition, but the skin 
picking persists after the dermatological condition resolves.
•	 For some individuals, an urge to pick at their skin may be preceded by emotional triggers 
such as increasing feelings of anxiety and tension or boredom. Others may pick at their 
skin in response to tactile sensitivity (i.e. skin irregularities) or bothersome skin sensations. 
In such cases, skin picking often results in an alleviation of tension, relief or a sense of 
gratification.
•	 Excoriation disorder is generally considered a chronic condition. Some individuals may 
experience a waxing and waning of symptoms over weeks, months or years at a time.
Developmental presentations
•	 Excoriation disorder most often has its onset during adolescence, typically corresponding 
to puberty. However, the emergence of symptoms can occur across the lifespan.
•	 Childhood-onset excoriation disorder is more prevalent among females.
•	 Automatic skin picking, which tends to occur unintentionally, outside awareness, appears 
more frequently among individuals with childhood-onset excoriation disorder. Skin 
picking then appears to shift in adolescence and adulthood, as picking becomes focused. 
This picking appears to be generally intentional, connected to intense urges to pick, and 
often results in a sense of relief.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Prevalence rates for excoriation disorder are significantly higher among women.
•	 Men have an earlier age of onset for the disorder.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Repetitive behaviours observed in excoriation disorder occur in other obsessive-compulsive 
and related disorders, but these are typically related to specific foci of apprehension, and are 
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders | Body-focused repetitive behaviour disorders

Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
associated with distinct intent for each diagnostic entity. Individuals diagnosed with obsessive-
compulsive disorder may engage in skin-picking behaviour (e.g. when they experience 
contamination obsessions that are associated with behaviours intended to pick the skin to remove 
contamination). Obsessions do not precede skin picking in excoriation disorder, and individuals 
with obsessive-compulsive disorder often exhibit other compulsions that are unrelated to skin 
picking. Nonetheless, co-occurrence with obsessive-compulsive disorder is common, and both 
disorders may be diagnosed if warranted. Body dysmorphic disorder may be associated with 
picking as a means of improving the individual’s appearance by “removing” acne or other perceived 
blemishes of the skin that the individual believes are ugly or that appear abnormal. Individuals 
with excoriation disorder do not pick skin with the sole purpose of correcting a perceived defect 
in appearance.
Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder
Stereotyped movement disorder is characterized by the persistent (e.g. lasting for several months) 
presence of voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless and often rhythmic 
movements (e.g. body rocking, hand flapping, head banging, eye poking and hand biting). 
These behaviours rarely include skin-picking behaviour, but if they do, the behaviour tends 
to be composed of coordinated movements that are patterned and predictable. Furthermore, 
stereotyped movements are more likely to present very early in life (i.e. before 2 years of age), 
whereas excoriation disorder typically has a later onset.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders may pick at their skin in 
response to a delusion or hallucination. Individuals with excoriation disorder do not report skin 
picking secondary to delusions or hallucinations.
Boundary with Prader-Willi syndrome
Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome may have early onset of skin picking more consistent 
with a stereotyped movement disorder. Prader-Willi syndrome is usually associated with a 
constellation of other symptoms, such as mild to moderate disorder of intellectual development, 
neonatal and infantile hypotonia, feeding problems and poor weight gain in infancy, followed by 
hyperphagia and morbid obesity in childhood.
Boundary with medical conditions classified elsewhere and disorders due to 
substance use
The symptoms of excoriation disorder are not a manifestation of another medical condition 
(e.g. scabies). However, skin picking may emerge following or be worsened by the presence of 
another condition (e.g. acne), and a diagnosis of excoriation disorder may be applied in this 
circumstance if diagnostic requirements are met. Skin picking may also result from the use or 
misuse of stimulants (e.g. cocaine, methamfetamine, prescription stimulants), but excoriation 
disorder should not be diagnosed if the skin picking occurs exclusively in this context.
Boundary with self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviours
Unlike self-injurious and self-mutilating behaviours, skin-picking behaviours characteristic of 
excoriation disorder are not performed with the express purpose of self-injury, although such 
injury may occur as a result.

disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder).
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, 
including withdrawal effects.

Disinhibited social engagement disorder
Disorders specifically associated with stress are directly related to exposure to a stressful or 
traumatic event, or to a series of such events or adverse experiences. For each of the disorders in this 
grouping, an identifiable stressor is a necessary, though not sufficient, causal factor. Most people 
who experience stressors do not develop a disorder. Stressful events for some disorders in this 
grouping are within the normal range of life experiences (e.g. divorce, socioeconomic problems, 
bereavement). Other disorders require exposure to a stressor that is extremely threatening or 
horrific in nature (i.e. potentially traumatic events). With all disorders in this grouping, it is the 
nature, pattern and duration of the symptoms that arise in response to the stressful events – 
together with associated functional impairment – that distinguishes the disorders.
Disorders specifically associated with stress include the following:
The categories in the grouping of disorders specifically associated with stress should not be used

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

General cultural considerations for disorders specifically associated 
with stress
•	 Culturally sanctioned and recognized concepts and means of expressing distress – such 
as local idioms of distress, explanations and syndromes – may be a prominent part of the 
trauma response. Examples of these cultural concepts include possession states in many 
cultural groups, susto or espanto (fright) among Latin American populations, ohkumlang 
(tiredness) and bodily pain among Bhutanese refugees who have survived torture, 
ihahamuka (lungs without breath) among Rwandan genocide survivors, and kit chraen 
(thinking too much) among Cambodians, among others. The symptoms of disorders 
specifically associated with stress may be described in terms of emotional, cognitive, 
behavioural and somatic elements of these cultural concepts. Idioms of distress may also 
influence the symptomatology and co-occurrence of other mental disorders.
•	 Individuals from collectivistic cultures may focus their concern on family and community 
relationships rather than personal reactions to trauma. The clinical presentation may 
include guilt or shame about perceived failures to assist others or fulfil culturally important 
social roles. For example, survivors of sexual violence may be preoccupied with the shame 
their family may incur because of the event.
•	 Across cultures, traumatic events may be attributed to a variety of spiritual or supernatural 
causes, such as karma, fate, envy, witchcraft/sorcery or vengeful spirits. These attributions 
influence the personal and social impact of stressors and the nature of the individual’s 
response.
•	 Knowledge of cultural norms is necessary to assess the severity of the trauma response – 
in particular, whether psychotic symptoms should be considered consistent with certain 
cultural expressions of the disorder, a manifestation of another mental disorder (e.g. a 
psychotic disorder) or consistent with normal functioning within that cultural context.
•	 The traumatic impact of certain exposures may be strongly influenced by cultural 
interpretations. For example, for some cultural groups, exposure to the destruction of 
religious and holy sites or sacred artifacts may be more stressful than personal trauma. It is 
the characteristic syndromic response that determines whether a diagnosis of a particular 
disorder is appropriate.
•	 Migrant populations may experience higher levels of distress related to traumatic exposure 
as a function of concomitant social factors, including poverty, discrimination by the 
receiving community and acculturative stressors.
Disorders specifically associated with stress 

Disorders specifically associated with stress
Post-traumatic stress disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Exposure to an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening 
or horrific nature is required for diagnosis. Such events include, but are not limited to, 
directly experiencing natural or human-made disasters, combat, serious accidents, torture, 
sexual violence, terrorism, assault or acute life-threatening illness (e.g. a heart attack); 
witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected or 
violent manner; and learning about the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one.
•	 Following the traumatic event or situation, the development of a characteristic syndrome 
lasting for at least several weeks consists of all three of the following core elements.
•	 The traumatic event is re-experienced in the present: it is not just remembered but is 
experienced as occurring again in the here and now. This typically occurs in the form 
of vivid intrusive memories or images; flashbacks, which can vary from mild (there is a 
transient sense of the event occurring again in the present) to severe (there is a complete 
loss of awareness of present surroundings); or repetitive dreams or nightmares that are 
thematically related to the traumatic event. Re-experiencing is typically accompanied by 
strong or overwhelming emotions, such as fear or horror, and strong physical sensations. 
Re-experiencing in the present can also involve feelings of being overwhelmed or 
immersed in the same intense emotions that were experienced during the traumatic 
event, without a prominent cognitive aspect, and may occur in response to reminders 
of the event. Reflecting on or ruminating about the event and remembering the feelings 
experienced at that time are not sufficient to meet the re-experiencing requirement.
•	 Reminders likely to produce re-experiencing of the traumatic event are deliberately 
avoided. Deliberate avoidance may take the form either of active internal avoidance 
of thoughts and memories related to the event, or external avoidance of people, 
conversations, activities or situations reminiscent of the event. In extreme cases, the 
person may change their environment (e.g. move to a different city or change jobs) to 
avoid reminders.
•	 There are persistent perceptions of heightened current threat – for example, as indicated 
by hypervigilance or an enhanced startle reaction to stimuli such as unexpected noises. 
Hypervigilant people constantly guard themselves against danger, and feel themselves 
or others close to them to be under immediate threat either in specific situations or more 
generally. They may adopt new behaviours designed to ensure safety (e.g. not sitting with 
their back to the door, repeatedly checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirrors).
•	 The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
6B40
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Common symptomatic presentations of post-traumatic stress disorder may also include 
general dysphoria, dissociative symptoms, somatic complaints, suicidal ideation and 
behaviour, social withdrawal, excessive alcohol or drug use to avoid re-experiencing 
or manage emotional reactions, anxiety symptoms including panic, and obsessions or 
compulsions in response to memories or reminders of the trauma.
•	 The emotional experience of individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder commonly 
includes anger, shame, sadness, humiliation or guilt, including survivor guilt.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 A history of exposure to an event or situation of an extremely threatening or horrific 
nature does not in itself indicate the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Many 
people experience such stressors without developing a disorder. Rather, the presentation 
must meet all diagnostic requirements for the disorder.
Course features
•	 Onset of post-traumatic stress disorder can occur at any time during the lifespan following 
exposure to a traumatic event.
•	 Onset of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms typically occurs within 3 months 
following exposure to a traumatic event. However, delays in the expression of post-traumatic 
stress disorder symptomology can occur even years after exposure to a traumatic event.
•	 The symptoms and course of post-traumatic stress disorder can vary significantly over 
time and among individuals. Recurrence of symptoms may occur after to exposure to 
reminders of the traumatic event or as a result of experiencing additional life stressors 
or traumatic events. Some individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder can 
experience persistent symptoms for months or years without reprieve.
•	 Nearly half of individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder will experience 
complete recovery of symptoms within 3 months of onset.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
Developmental presentations
•	 Post-traumatic stress disorder can occur at all ages, but responses to a traumatic event – that 
is, the core elements of the characteristic syndrome – can manifest differently depending 
on age and developmental stage.
•	 Emerging cognitive capacities and limited verbal abilities for self-reporting in young 
children (e.g. under 6 years of age) make it more difficult to assess for the presence of re-
experiencing, active avoidance of internal states and perceptions of heightened current 
threat. Assessments of symptoms should not be based exclusively on child-reported 
internal symptoms, but should include caregiver reports of observable behavioural 
symptoms emerging after traumatic experiences.
•	 In younger children, evidence of the core symptoms supporting a diagnosis of post-
traumatic stress disorder often manifests behaviourally, such as in trauma-specific 
re-enactments that may occur during repetitive play or in drawings, frightening dreams 
without clear content or night terrors, or uncharacteristic impulsivity. However, children 
may not necessarily appear distressed when talking about or playing out their traumatic 
recollections, despite substantial impact on psychosocial functioning and development. 
Other manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder in preschool-aged children may be 
less trauma-specific and include both inhibited and disinhibited behaviours. For example, 
hypervigilance may manifest as increased frequency and intensity of temper tantrums, 
separation anxiety, regression in skills (e.g. verbal skills, toileting), exaggerated age-
associated fears or excessive crying. External avoidance or expressions of recollection of 
traumatic experiences may be evidenced by a new onset of acting out, protective or rescue 
strategies, limited exploration or reluctance to engage in new activities, and excessive 
reassurance-seeking from a trusted caregiver.
•	 Limited capacity to reflect on and report internal states may also be characteristic of some 
school-aged children and adolescents. Furthermore, children and adolescents may be 
more reluctant than adults to report their reactions to traumatic events. In such cases, 
greater reliance on changes in behaviour such as increased trauma-specific re-enactments 
or overt avoidance may be necessary.
•	 Children or adolescents may deny feelings of distress or horror associated with re-
experiencing, and rather report no affect or other types of strong or overwhelming 
emotions as a part of re-experiencing, including those that are non-distressing.
•	 In adolescence, reluctance to pursue developmental opportunities (e.g. to gain 
autonomy from caregivers) may be a sign of psychosocial impairment. Self-injurious or 
risky behaviours (e.g. substance use or unprotected sex) occur at elevated rates among 
adolescents and adults with post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 Assessment can be complicated in children and adolescents when loss of a parent or 
caregiver is associated with a traumatic event or an intervention. For example, a chronically 
abused child who is removed from the home may place greater emphasis on the loss of a 
primary caregiver than on aspects of the experience that might objectively be considered 
more threatening or horrific.
•	 Among older adults with post-traumatic stress disorder, symptom severity may decline 
over the life-course – especially re-experiencing. However, avoidance of situations, people, 
activities or conversations about the event, as well as hypervigilance, typically persist. 
Older people may dismiss their symptoms as a normal part of life, which may be related to 
shame and fear of stigma.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 The salience of particular post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may vary across 
cultures. For example, in some groups anger may be the most prominent symptom related 
to traumatic exposure, and the most culturally appropriate way of expressing distress. In 
other cultural contexts, nightmares may have elaborate cultural significance that increases 
their importance in assessing for the characteristic symptoms of post-traumatic stress 
disorder.
•	 Symptoms central to post-traumatic stress disorder in some cultures may not be included 
in descriptions of the disorder, and may therefore be missed by clinicians unfamiliar with 
those cultural expressions. For example, somatic symptoms such as headaches (often with 
visual aura), dizziness, bodily heat, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal distress, trembling 
and orthostatic hypotension may be prominent.
•	 Cultural variation may affect post-traumatic stress disorder onset and the meaning of 
traumatic stressors. For example, some cultural groups attribute greater risk of post-
traumatic stress disorder to traumatic events affecting family members than those affecting 
the person themselves; other societies may find it particularly traumatic to observe the 
desecration or destruction of religious symbols or to be denied the ability to perform 
funeral rites for deceased relatives.
•	 Certain trauma-related symptoms may be associated with intense fear in particular 
cultural contexts owing to their connection with specific catastrophic cognitions, and may 
precipitate panic attacks in the context of post-traumatic stress disorder. These catastrophic 
interpretations may affect the trajectory of the disorder, and may be associated with greater 
severity, chronicity or poorer response to treatment. For example, some Latin American 
patients may consider trauma-related trembling to be the precursor of a lifelong condition 
of severe nervios (nerves), and some Cambodians may interpret palpitations as signs of a 
“weak heart”.
•	 Some post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may not be viewed as pathological in 
some cultural groups. For example, intrusive thoughts may be considered normal rather 
than a symptom indicating illness. It is important to evaluate the presence of all required 
diagnostic elements, including functional impairment, rather than treating any one 
symptom as pathognomic.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Post-traumatic stress disorder is more common among females.
•	 Females diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to experience a 
longer duration of impairment and higher levels of negative emotionality and somatic 
symptoms as a part of their clinical presentation.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with complex post-traumatic stress disorder
Whereas the diagnostic requirements for complex post-traumatic stress disorder include all 
essential features of post-traumatic stress disorder, the diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress 
disorder also requires the additional essential features of severe problems in affect regulation, 
persistent negative beliefs about oneself, and persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships.
Boundary with prolonged grief disorder
As with post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder may occur in individuals who 
experience bereavement as a result of the death of a loved one occurring in traumatic circumstances. 
In post-traumatic stress disorder the individual re-experiences the event or situation associated 
with the death, while in prolonged grief disorder the person may be preoccupied with memories 
of the circumstances surrounding the death but, unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, does not 
re-experience them as occurring again in the here and now.
Boundary with adjustment disorder
In adjustment disorder, the stressor can be of any severity or any type, and is not necessarily of 
an extremely threatening or horrific nature. A response to a less serious event or situation that 
otherwise meets the symptom requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder but that is beyond 
the duration appropriate for acute stress reaction should be diagnosed as adjustment disorder. 
Moreover, many people who experience an extremely threatening or horrific event develop 
symptoms that do not meet the full diagnostic requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder; 
these reactions are generally better diagnosed as adjustment disorder.
Boundary with acute stress reaction
Normal acute reactions to traumatic events can include all the symptoms of post-traumatic stress 
disorder, including re-experiencing, but these begin to subside fairly quickly (e.g. within 1 week 
after the event terminates or after removal from the threatening situation, or within 1 month in 
the case of ongoing stressors). If clinical intervention is warranted in these situations, a diagnosis 
of acute stress reaction from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health 
services (i.e. a non-disorder category) is generally most appropriate.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Some individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder re-experience traumatic events in the form 
of severe flashbacks that may have a hallucinatory quality, or are hypervigilant to threat to the 
extent that they may appear to be paranoid. Auditory pseudo-hallucinations, recognized as being 
the person’s own thoughts and of internal origin, can occur in post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Such symptoms should not be considered evidence of a psychotic disorder.
Boundary with depressive episode
In a depressive episode, intrusive memories are not experienced as occurring again in the present, 
but as belonging to the past, and they are often accompanied by rumination. However, depressive 
episodes commonly co-occur with post-traumatic stress disorder, and an additional mood 
disorder diagnosis should be assigned if warranted.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Post-traumatic stress disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with panic disorder
In post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks can be triggered by reminders of the traumatic 
event or in the context of re-experiencing. Panic attacks that occur entirely in these contexts do 
not warrant an additional, separate diagnosis of panic disorder. Instead, the with panic attacks 
specifier (MB23.H) may be applied together with the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis. 
However, if unexpected panic attacks (i.e. those that come on “out of the blue”) are also present 
and the other diagnostic requirements are met, an additional diagnosis of panic disorder 
is appropriate.
Boundary with specific phobia
In some cases, a situational or conditioned specific phobia can arise after exposure to a traumatic 
event (e.g. being attacked by a dog). Specific phobia can generally be differentiated from post-
traumatic stress disorder by the absence of re-experiencing of the event in the present. Although 
phobic responses may include powerful memories of the event, in response to which the individual 
experiences anxiety, the memories are experienced as belonging to the past.
Boundary with dissociative disorders
Following an experience of a traumatic event, a variety of dissociative symptoms can occur, 
including somatic symptoms, memory disturbances, flashbacks or other trance-like states, 
alterations in identity and sense of agency, and experiences of depersonalization, especially 
during the episodes of re-experiencing. If the dissociative symptoms are confined to episodes of 
re-experiencing in an individual with post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder, an additional diagnosis of a dissociative disorder should not be assigned. 
If significant dissociative symptoms are present outside episodes of re-experiencing, and the full 
diagnostic requirements are met, an additional dissociative disorder diagnosis may be assigned.
Boundary with other mental disorders
It is common for mental disorders other than or in addition to post-traumatic stress disorder to 
develop in the aftermath of an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely 
threatening or horrific nature. Thus, a history of exposure to a potentially traumatic event does 
not in itself indicate the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Depressive disorders, anxiety 
and fear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and dissociative disorders can all occur 
in the aftermath of potentially traumatic experiences, often in the absence of post-traumatic 
stress disorder.
Complex post-traumatic stress disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Exposure to an event or series of events of an extremely threatening or horrific nature – most 
commonly prolonged or repetitive events from which escape is difficult or impossible – is 
required for diagnosis. Such events include, but are not limited to, torture, concentration 
camps, slavery, genocide campaigns and other forms of organized violence, prolonged 
domestic violence, and repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse.

•	 Following the traumatic event, the development of a characteristic syndrome lasting for 
at least several weeks consists of all three of the following core elements of post-traumatic

their back to the door, repeatedly checking in vehicles’ rear-view mirrors). In complex 
post-traumatic stress disorder, unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, the startle reaction 
may in some cases be diminished rather than enhanced.
•	 The presentation is characterized by severe and pervasive problems in affect regulation. 
Examples include heightened emotional reactivity to minor stressors, violent outbursts, 
reckless or self-destructive behaviour, dissociative symptoms when under stress, and 
emotional numbing – particularly the inability to experience pleasure or positive emotions.
•	 Persistent beliefs about oneself as diminished, defeated or worthless are accompanied by 
deep and pervasive feelings of shame, guilt or failure related to the stressor. For example, 
the individual may feel guilty about not having escaped from or succumbing to the adverse 
circumstance, or not having been able to prevent the suffering of others.
•	 Persistent difficulties in sustaining relationships and in feeling close to others are present. 
The individual may consistently avoid, deride or have little interest in relationships 
and social engagement more generally. Alternatively, there may be occasional intense 
relationships, but the individual has difficulty sustaining them.
•	 The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.

disorder. Rather, the presentation must meet all diagnostic requirements for the disorder.

•	 The onset of complex post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms can occur across the lifespan 
– typically after exposure to chronic, repeated traumatic events and/or victimization that 
have continued for a period of months or years at a time.
•	 Symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder are generally more severe and 
persistent in comparison to those of post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 Exposure to repeated traumas, especially in early development, is associated with a greater 
risk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder rather than post-traumatic 
stress disorder.
Developmental presentations
•	 Complex post-traumatic stress disorder can occur at all ages, but responses to a traumatic 
event – that is, the core elements of the characteristic syndrome – can manifest differently 
depending on age and developmental stage. Because complex post-traumatic stress 
disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder share these same core elements, information 
provided in the developmental presentations section for post-traumatic stress disorder also 
applies to children and adolescents affected by complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 Children and adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to developing complex post-
traumatic stress disorder when exposed to severe, prolonged trauma such as chronic child 
abuse, participation in drug trafficking or being used as child soldiers. Many children and 
adolescents exposed to trauma have been exposed to multiple traumas, which increases 
the risk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Complex post-traumatic stress disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
•	 Children and adolescents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely than 
their peers to demonstrate cognitive difficulties (e.g. problems with attention, planning, 
organizing) that may in turn interfere with academic and occupational functioning.
•	 In children, pervasive problems of affect regulation and persistent difficulties in sustaining 
relationships may manifest as regression, reckless behaviour or aggressive behaviours 
towards themselves or others, and in difficulties relating to peers. Furthermore, problems 
of affect regulation may manifest as dissociation, suppression of emotional experience and 
expression, and avoidance of situations or experiences that may elicit emotions, including 
positive emotions.
•	 In adolescence, substance use, risk-taking behaviours (e.g. unsafe sex, unsafe driving, non-
suicidal self-harm) and aggressive behaviours may be particularly evident as expressions of 
problems of affect dysregulation and interpersonal difficulties.
•	 When parents or caregivers are the source of the trauma (e.g. sexual abuse), children 
and adolescents often develop a disorganized attachment style that can manifest as 
unpredictable behaviours towards these individuals (e.g. alternating between neediness, 
rejection and aggression). In children under 5 years of age, attachment disturbances related 
to maltreatment may also include reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social 
engagement disorder, which can co-occur with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 Children and adolescents with complex post-traumatic stress disorder often report 
symptoms consistent with depressive disorders, eating and feeding disorders, sleep-
wake disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, 
conduct-dissocial disorder and separation anxiety disorder. The relationship of traumatic 
experiences to the onset of symptoms can be useful in establishing a differential diagnosis. 
At the same time, other mental disorders can also develop following extremely stressful 
or traumatic experiences. Additional co-occurring diagnoses should only be made if the 
symptoms are not fully accounted for by complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and all 
diagnostic requirements for each disorder are met.
•	 In older adults, complex post-traumatic stress disorder may be dominated by anxious 
avoidance of thoughts, feelings, memories and people, as well as physiological symptoms of 
anxiety (e.g. enhanced startle reaction, autonomic hyper-reactivity). Affected individuals 
may experience intense regret related to the impact of traumatic experiences on their lives.
Culture-related features
•	 Cultural variation exists in the expression of symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress 
disorder. For example, somatic or dissociative symptoms may be more prominent in 
certain groups, attributable to cultural interpretations of the psychological, physiological 
and spiritual etiology of these symptoms and of high levels of arousal.
•	 Given the severe, prolonged or recurrent nature of the traumatic events that precipitate 
complex post-traumatic stress disorder, collective suffering and the destruction of social 
bonds, networks and communities may present as a focal concern or as important related 
features of the disorder.
•	 For migrant communities – especially refugees or asylum seekers – complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder may be exacerbated by acculturative stressors and the social environment 
in the host country.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Complex post-traumatic stress disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Females are at greater risk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 Females with complex post-traumatic stress disorder are more likely to exhibit a greater 
level of psychological distress and functional impairment.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with personality disorder
Many individuals with personality disorder have a history of traumatic events, particularly in 
childhood, and affective dysregulation can be a feature of both complex PTSD and personality 
disorder, particularly personality disorder with borderline pattern. However, there are several 
ways in which the specific symptom profiles of the two disorders differ. Avoidance of trauma-
related reminders and a heightened sense of current threat are not diagnostic features of 
personality disorders. Intimate and interpersonal relationships in complex PTSD are less likely 
to be characterized by fear of abandonment and relationship instability, but rather by avoidance 
and a general sense of disconnection. Individuals with complex PTSD tend to manifest a stable 
but persistently negative self-view, in contrast to personality disorder in which an unstable sense 
of self is more common. Whereas personality disorder is more likely to be characterized by 
frequent impulsive behaviors, including impulsive suicidality, suicidality among individuals with 
complex PTSD tends to be less frequent, less impulsive, and of higher lethality. If the diagnostic 
requirements for both disorders are met, the utility of assigning an additional diagnosis of 
personality disorder depends on the specific clinical situation.
Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
Because the diagnostic requirements for complex post-traumatic stress disorder include all 
essential features of post-traumatic stress disorder, guidance provided in the sections on 
boundary with normality (threshold) and boundaries with other disorders and conditions 
(differential diagnosis) for post-traumatic stress disorder also applies to complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder.
Prolonged grief disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A history of bereavement following the death of a partner, parent, child or other person 
close to the bereaved is required for diagnosis.
6B42
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Prolonged grief disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
•	 A persistent and pervasive grief response is characterized by longing for the deceased or 
persistent preoccupation with the deceased, accompanied by intense emotional pain. This 
may be manifested in experiences such as sadness, guilt, anger, denial, blame, difficulty 
accepting the death, the individual feeling that they have lost a part of themselves, an 
inability to experience positive mood, emotional numbness and difficulty in engaging with 
social or other activities.
•	 The pervasive grief response has persisted for an atypically long period of time following 
the loss, markedly exceeding expected social, cultural or religious norms for the individual’s 
culture and context. Grief responses lasting for less than 6 months, and for longer periods 
in some cultural contexts, should not be regarded as meeting this requirement.
•	 The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Persistent preoccupation may focus on the circumstances of the death, or manifest as 
behaviours such as the preservation of all the deceased person’s belongings exactly as they 
were before their death. The individual may alternate between excessive preoccupation 
and avoidance of reminders of the deceased.
•	 Other features of prolonged grief disorder may include problems coping without the loved 
one, difficulties in recalling positive memories of the deceased, difficulty trusting others, 
social withdrawal and the feeling that life is meaningless.
•	 Increased tobacco, alcohol and other substance use, as well as increased suicidal ideation 
and behaviour, may be present.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 An individual experiencing a grief reaction that is within a normative period given their 
cultural and religious context is considered to be experiencing normal bereavement, 
and should not be assigned a diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder. It is often important 
to consider whether other people who share the bereaved person’s cultural or religious 
perspective (e.g. family, friends, community) regard the response to the loss or duration of 
the reaction as abnormal.
•	 Children and adolescents may respond to the loss of a primary attachment figure (e.g. a 
parent or caregiver) with an intense and sustained grief response (e.g. greater in intensity, 
symptomatology, duration) because of the role these individuals play in the child’s life. 
Preschool-aged children commonly have difficulty accepting the loss. Aspects of the grief 
response may be retriggered at various points during the individual’s development – for 
example, as new needs arise that would normally be supplied by the parent or caregiver. 
Generally, these reactions should be regarded as normal, and the diagnosis of prolonged 
grief disorder should be assigned with caution to children and adolescents in this situation.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Prolonged grief disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Developmental presentations
•	 Prolonged grief disorder can occur at all ages, but the grief response can differ depending 
on the age and developmental stage, and thus on age-specific concepts of death.
•	 Children often do not explicitly describe the experience of longing for the deceased or 
persistent preoccupation with the death of a loved one. These symptoms may be more 
likely to manifest behaviourally, such as in play or in other behaviours involving themes of 
separation or death. Other behavioural expressions of longing can include waiting for the 
deceased person to return or returning to places where they last saw the deceased. Some 
children may develop a fearful preoccupation that others may die, or separation anxiety 
centring on worries about their caregivers’ welfare and safety.
•	 In younger children, intense sadness or emotional pain may emerge intermittently with 
seemingly appropriate moods. Anger related to the loss may be exhibited in children 
and adolescents as irritability, protest behaviour, tantrums, oppositional behaviour or 
conduct problems.
•	 Various contextual factors can influence symptoms related to the death of a loved one in 
children. For example, delayed onset or worsening of symptoms may occur in response to 
a change in a child or adolescent’s social environment, the degree of coping of parents or 
caregivers with the loss, and family communication.
•	 In older adults, prolonged grief disorder may manifest as enduring depression, with the 
feeling that they have lost a part of themselves, and accentuated feelings of emptiness. 
Feelings of being stunned and dazed over the loss are common. A preoccupation with 
somatic complaints is often found to be the primary sign of distress at this 
developmental stage.
Culture-related features
•	 Cultural practices vary with regard to appropriate emotional expressions of bereavement, 
rituals and practices for managing the grieving process, modes of commemorating the 
deceased, concepts of an afterlife, stigma associated with certain types of death (e.g. 
suicide) or situations that may be especially traumatic (e.g. death of a child). This variation 
may contribute to the likelihood of experiencing prolonged grief reactions, and to the 
range of symptoms and clinical presentations.
•	 Cultural groups vary regarding the normative duration of grief reactions. Among some 
groups, prescribed grief reactions may last for 1 year, or may even be postponed until the 
first anniversary. Among others, rituals or ceremonies are expected to prompt negative 
emotions related to loss, and formal grieving periods are relatively short. It is often 
important to consider whether other people who share the bereaved person’s cultural or 
religious perspective (e.g. family, friends, community) regard the response to the loss or 
duration of the reaction as abnormal.
•	 In some cultural or religious traditions, death is seen not as the cessation of life but as 
an important transition to another form of existence. Such cultural beliefs may focus on 
karma, rebirth, heaven/hell, purgatory or other transitions into the afterlife. Culturally 
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Prolonged grief disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
specific rituals and yearly celebrations may aim to assure the auspicious spiritual status 
of the deceased. Prolonged grief may be associated with concern about the status of the 
deceased in the afterlife.
•	 Encounters with the deceased may vary greatly across cultures. For example, in some 
societies, any waking encounter with the deceased is considered abnormal. By contrast, it 
is common in many southern European and Latin American societies to receive visitations 
from deceased relatives soon after their death, which may be comforting to the bereaved. 
Other groups (e.g. some American Indians) may encounter the deceased in dreams, with 
a variety of interpretations. Among Cambodians, for example, having dreams of the 
deceased may be highly upsetting, indicating that rebirth has not occurred.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Prolonged grief disorder is more prevalent among females.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder
As with post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder may occur in individuals 
who experience bereavement as a result of the death of a loved one occurring in traumatic 
circumstances. In prolonged grief disorder the person may be preoccupied with memories of the 
circumstances surrounding the death, but unlike in post-traumatic stress disorder, they do not 
re-experience them as occurring again in the here and now.
Boundary with depressive episode
Some common symptoms of prolonged grief disorder are similar to those observed in a depressive 
episode (e.g. sadness, loss of interest in activities, social withdrawal, feelings of guilt, suicidal 
ideation). However, prolonged grief disorder is differentiated from a depressive episode because 
symptoms are specifically focused on the loss of the loved one, whereas depressive thoughts and 
emotional reactions typically encompass multiple areas of life. Further, other common symptoms 
of prolonged grief disorder (e.g. difficulty accepting the loss, feeling angry about the loss, feeling 
as though a part of the individual has died) are not characteristic of a depressive episode. 
The timing of the onset of the symptoms in relation to the loss and whether there is a prior history 
of depressive or bipolar disorder are important to consider in making this distinction. However, 
prolonged grief disorder and mood disorders can co-occur, and both should be diagnosed if the 
full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Prolonged grief disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Adjustment disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A maladaptive reaction to an identifiable psychosocial stressor or multiple stressors 
(e.g. single stressful event, ongoing psychosocial difficulty or a combination of stressful life 
situations) that usually emerges within a month of the stressor is required for diagnosis. 
Examples include divorce or loss of a relationship, loss of a job, diagnosis of an illness, 
recent onset of a disability, and conflicts at home or work.
•	 The reaction to the stressor is characterized by preoccupation with the stressor or its 
consequences, including excessive worry, recurrent and distressing thoughts about the 
stressor, or constant rumination about its implications.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a mood 
disorder, another disorder specifically associated with stress).
•	 Once the stressor and its consequences have ended, the symptoms resolve within 6 months.
•	 Failure to adapt to the stressor results in significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Symptoms of preoccupation may worsen with reminders of the stressor, resulting in 
avoidance of stimuli, thoughts, feelings or discussions associated with the stressor to 
prevent preoccupation or distress.
•	 Additional psychological symptoms of adjustment disorder may include depressive or 
anxiety symptoms, as well as impulsive “externalizing” symptoms – particularly increased 
tobacco, alcohol or other substance use.
•	 Symptoms of adjustment disorder usually abate when the stressor is removed, when 
sufficient support is provided, or when the affected person develops additional coping 
mechanisms or strategies.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Adjustment disorder represents a maladaptive reaction and failure to adapt to a stressor 
that is associated with significant preoccupation, and results in significant impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 
Emotional reactions to negative life events that do not meet these requirements should not 
be diagnosed as adjustment disorder.
6B43
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Adjustment disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
•	 Symptoms that occur as transient responses and resolve within a few days do not typically 
warrant a diagnosis of adjustment disorder.
•	 In cases in which responses to traumatic events are considered normal given the severity 
of the stressor, a diagnosis of acute stress reaction from Chapter 24 on factors influencing 
health status or contact with health services (i.e. a non-disorder category) is generally 
most appropriate.
Course features
•	 Onset of adjustment disorder usually occurs within 1 month after exposure to a stressful 
life event (i.e. illness, marital distress). However, onset can occur after a longer delay 
(e.g. 3 months after exposure).
•	 Acute and intense stressful life events (e.g. sudden job loss) typically result in a 
correspondingly precipitous onset of symptoms that tend to have a shorter duration, 
whereas more persistent stressful life events (e.g. ongoing marital distress) typically result 
in delayed onset of symptoms and a longer duration.
•	 The intensity and duration of adjustment disorder varies widely.
Developmental presentations
•	 In children, the characteristic symptoms of preoccupation with a stressor or its consequences 
or constant rumination about the stressor are often not expressed directly but rather 
are manifested in somatic symptoms (e.g. stomach pains or headaches), disruptive or 
oppositional behaviour, hyperactivity, tantrums, concentration problems, irritability and 
increased clinginess. Other reactions to stressors – including regression, bedwetting and 
sleep disturbances – may be a manifestation of adjustment disorder if they are persistent 
(e.g. have been present for approximately 1 month).
•	 In adolescents, behavioural manifestations of adjustment disorder can include substance 
use and various forms of acting out or risk-taking.
•	 Because children and adolescents may not explicitly verbalize a connection between 
stressful events and their own symptoms and behaviours, in making the diagnosis it is 
important to consider the temporal relationship between the stressor and the onset of 
symptoms, and the extent to which they constitute a change from prior functioning.
•	 Among older adults, preoccupation with somatic complaints is a common sign of distress 
related to stressors. Older adults who suffer from adjustment disorder tend to express 
greater anxiety about their health, report significant demoralization, and often display 
persistent somatization of psychological symptoms.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Adjustment disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Adjustment disorder may be exacerbated in the context of limited family or community 
support, particularly in collectivistic or sociocentric cultures. In these societies, the focus 
of the preoccupation may extend to stressors affecting close relatives or friends.
•	 Symptoms of adjustment disorder may be influenced by local idioms associated with fear 
(e.g. susto or espanto (fright) in Latin America) or preoccupation with stressors that have 
strong cultural connotations (e.g. intense fear related to crossing unpopulated areas alone 
at night).
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder
In adjustment disorder, the stressor can be of any severity or any type, and is not necessarily 
of an extremely threatening or horrific nature. A response to a less serious event or situation 
that otherwise meets the symptom requirements for post-traumatic stress disorder should be 
diagnosed as adjustment disorder. Moreover, many people who have experienced an extremely 
threatening or horrific event develop adjustment disorder and not post-traumatic stress disorder 
in its aftermath. The distinction should be made based on whether the full diagnostic requirements 
for either disorder are met, not solely on the type of stressor.
Boundary with other mental disorders
It is common for mental disorders to be triggered or exacerbated by stressful life experiences. 
Moreover, many mental disorders can involve symptoms including maladaptive reactions to 
stressors, preoccupation with stressors and excessive worry or rumination, and failure to adapt. 
In the presence of another mental disorder that can account for these symptoms (e.g. a primary 
psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, another disorder specifically associated with stress, a 
personality disorder, an obsessive-compulsive or related disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, 
separation anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder), a separate diagnosis of adjustment 
disorder should generally not be assigned, even if stressful life events or changing circumstances 
have led to an exacerbation of the symptoms. However, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder 
may be assigned in the presence of other mental disorders with substantially non-overlapping 
symptomatology (e.g. specific phobia, panic disorder, bodily distress disorder) that do not fully 
account for the adjustment disorder symptoms, as long as the course of the two disorders is 
distinguishable and the full diagnostic requirements are met for each. If symptoms persist for 
longer than 6 months after a stressor has ended, it is generally appropriate to change the diagnosis 
to another relevant mental disorder.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Adjustment disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
Reactive attachment disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A history of grossly insufficient care is required for diagnosis, which may include:
•	 persistent disregard for the child’s basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation and 
affection;
•	 persistent disregard for the child’s basic physical needs;
•	 repeated changes of primary caregivers (e.g. frequent changes in foster-care providers);
•	 rearing in unusual settings (e.g. institutions) that prevent formation of stable selective 
attachments;
•	 maltreatment.
•	 Markedly abnormal attachment behaviours towards adult caregivers in a child are 
characterized by a persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn 
behaviour including both of the following:
•	 minimal seeking of comfort when distressed;
•	 rare or minimal response to comfort when it is offered.
•	 The grossly insufficient care is presumed to be responsible for the persistent and pervasive 
pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behaviour.
•	 The symptoms are evident before the age of 5 years.
•	 The child has reached a developmental level by which the capacity to form selective 
attachments with caregivers normally develops, which typically occurs at a chronological 
age of 1 year or a developmental age of at least 9 months.
•	 The abnormal attachment behaviours are not better accounted for by autism spectrum 
disorder.
•	 The abnormal attachment behaviours are not confined to a specific dyadic relationship.
Additional clinical features
•	 Persistent disregard for the child’s basic needs may meet the definition for neglect: egregious 
acts or omissions by a caregiver that deprive a child of needed age-appropriate care and that 
result, or have reasonable potential to result, in physical or psychological harm. Reactive 
attachment disorder is associated with persistent neglect rather than isolated incidents.
•	 Reactive attachment disorder may also be associated with persistent maltreatment, 
characterized by one or more of the following:
•	 non-accidental acts of physical force that result – or have reasonable potential to 
result – in physical harm, or that evoke significant fear;
•	 sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult;
•	 non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts that result in significant psychological harm.
6B44
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Reactive attachment disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Children with reactive attachment disorder related to repetitive maltreatment (e.g. chronic 
physical or sexual abuse) are at risk of developing co-occurring post-traumatic stress 
disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 Children with reactive attachment disorder often exhibit more generalized persistent 
social and emotional disturbances, including a relative lack of social and emotional 
responsiveness to others and limited positive affect. There may be episodes of unexplained 
irritability, sadness or fearfulness that are evident during non-threatening interactions 
with adult caregivers.
•	 Children with a history of grossly insufficient care but who have nonetheless formed 
selective attachments do not appear to develop reactive attachment disorder, but they may 
still be at risk of developing disinhibited social engagement disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Many children without a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder show transient 
reductions of attachment behaviours towards a parent or caregiver as a normal part of 
development. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder exhibit markedly 
atypical social responses towards caregivers that persist over time, extend across all social 
situations, and are not confined to a dyadic relationship with a particular caregiver.
Course features
•	 With the provision of adequate care, children with reactive attachment disorder often 
experience a near or complete remission of symptoms. If appropriate caregiving is not 
provided, the disorder can persist for several years.
•	 Children with reactive attachment disorder are at higher risk of developing depressive 
disorders and other internalizing disorders during adolescence and adulthood. They 
may also experience problems in developing and maintaining healthy interpersonal 
relationships.
•	 Information about the course features of reactive attachment disorder beyond the 
childhood years is limited.
•	 Some adults with a history of reactive attachment disorder may experience difficulty in 
developing interpersonal relationships.
Developmental presentations
•	 Caregiver neglect during the first 9 months of life is often an associated precursor to the 
onset of the disorder.
•	 The features of this disorder become noticeable in a similar fashion up to 5 years of age.
Disorders specifically associated with stress |  Reactive attachment disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
In contrast to individuals with autism spectrum disorder, children with reactive attachment 
disorder have the capacity for initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal 
social interactions. Although some children with reactive attachment disorder may show delays in 
language development due to a history of social neglect, they do not exhibit social communication 
deficits or the persistently restrictive, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and 
activities characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. Some individuals reared under conditions 
of severe deprivation in institutional settings exhibit autistic-like features, including difficulties 
in social reciprocity and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or 
activities. Also referred to as “quasi-autism”, affected individuals are differentiated from those 
with autism spectrum disorder based on significant improvement of autism-like features when 
the child is moved to a more nurturing environment.
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Children with disorders of intellectual development are able to form selective attachments to 
caregivers. Attachments usually develop consistent with the child’s general developmental level, 
and are typically evident by the time the child has reached a developmental age of at least 9 
months. Reactive attachment disorder should only be diagnosed if it is clear that the characteristic 
problems in the formation of selective attachments are not a result of limitations in intellectual 
functioning.
Boundary with social anxiety disorder
Social anxiety disorder in children may include emotionally withdrawn behaviours in social 
situations, or in anticipation of social encounters, due to marked and excessive fear or anxiety. 
Unlike in reactive attachment disorder, children with social anxiety disorder exhibit appropriate 
attachment behaviours with parents or caregivers, and seek comfort from them when distressed, 
but are typically fearful of unfamiliar individuals. Children with reactive attachment disorder 
exhibit emotionally withdrawn behaviours across all social contexts.
Boundary with depressive disorders
As with reactive attachment disorder, children with depressive disorders may exhibit emotionally 
withdrawn behaviour, as well as associated features of lack of social and emotional responsiveness 
to others, limited positive affect and/or episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness or fearfulness. 
However, unlike those with reactive attachment disorder, children with depressive disorders 
exhibit appropriate attachment behaviours with parents or caregivers, and seek comfort from 
them when distressed.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Reactive attachment disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Disinhibited social engagement disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A history of grossly insufficient care of a child is required for diagnosis, which may include:
•	 persistent disregard for the child’s basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation and 
affection;
•	 persistent disregard for the child’s basic physical needs;
•	 repeated changes of primary caregivers (e.g. frequent changes in foster-care providers);
•	 rearing in unusual settings (e.g. institutions) that prevent formation of stable selective 
attachments;
•	 maltreatment.
•	 A persistent and pervasive pattern of markedly abnormal social behaviours in a child, in 
which the child displays reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with 
unfamiliar adults, including one or more of the following:
•	 overly familiar behaviour with unfamiliar adults, including verbal or physical violation of 
socially appropriate physical and verbal boundaries (e.g. seeking comfort from unfamiliar 
adults, asking age-inappropriate questions to unfamiliar adults);
•	 diminished or absent checking back with an adult caregiver after venturing away, even 
in unfamiliar settings;
•	 a willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no hesitation.
•	 The symptoms are evident before the age of 5 years.
•	 The child has reached a developmental level by which the capacity to form selective 
attachments with caregivers normally develops, which typically occurs at a chronological 
age of 1 year or a developmental age of at least 9 months.
•	 The disinhibited social engagement behaviour is not better accounted for by another 
mental disorder (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).
Additional clinical features
•	 Persistent disregard for the child’s basic needs may meet the definition for neglect: 
egregious acts or omissions by a caregiver that deprive a child of needed age-appropriate 
care and that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in physical or psychological 
harm. Disinhibited social engagement disorder is associated with persistent neglect rather 
than isolated incidents.
•	 Disinhibited social engagement disorder may also be associated with persistent 
maltreatment, characterized by one or more of the following:
•	 non-accidental acts of physical force that result, or have reasonable potential to result, in 
physical harm or that evoke significant fear;
•	 sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult;
•	 non-accidental verbal or symbolic acts that results in significant psychological harm.
6B45
Disorders specifically associated with stress |  Disinhibited social engagement disorder

Disorders specifically associated with stress
•	 Children with a history of grossly insufficient care are at increased risk of developing 
disinhibited social engagement disorder – particularly when it occurs very early (e.g. prior 
to the age of 2 years). However, disinhibited social engagement disorder is rare, and most 
children with such a history do not develop the disorder.
•	 In contrast to reactive attachment disorder, symptoms of disinhibited social engagement 
disorder tend to be more persistent following the provision of appropriate care, even with 
the development of selective attachments.
•	 Children with disinhibited social engagement disorder related to repetitive maltreatment 
(e.g. chronic physical or sexual abuse) are at risk of developing co-occurring post-traumatic 
stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
•	 General impulsivity is commonly associated with disinhibited social engagement disorder, 
particularly among older children, and there is a high rate of co-occurrence with attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Children vary greatly in their temperamental features, and disinhibited social engagement 
disorder should be distinguished from the ebullience associated with an outgoing 
temperamental style. Distinguishing features of the disinhibited social engagement 
disorder are the dysfunctional nature of the behaviour and its association with a history of 
grossly insufficient care.
Course features
•	 Disinhibited social engagement disorder is moderately stable, and symptoms may persist 
throughout childhood and adolescence. Overly friendly behaviour appears to be relatively 
resistant to change.
•	 Individuals with disinhibited social engagement disorder who lived in institutions for an 
extended period of time appear to be at greatest risk of persistent symptoms, even after 
adoption. Early removal from an adverse environment decreases the likelihood that 
indiscriminate social behaviours will persist. Only some individuals with disinhibited 
social engagement disorder appear to respond to interventions targeting enhancement 
of caregiving.
•	 In adolescence, individuals with a history of disinhibited social engagement disorder 
demonstrate superficial peer relationships (e.g. identification of acquaintances as close 
friends) and other deficits in social functioning (e.g. increased conflict with peers).
•	 During childhood, disinhibited social engagement disorder often manifests in violation 
of socially appropriate physical (e.g. seeking comfort from unfamiliar adults) and verbal 
boundaries (e.g. asking inappropriate questions to unfamiliar adults).
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Disinhibited social engagement disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Developmental presentations
•	 Children and adolescents are at greater risk of disinhibited social engagement disorder if 
they have experienced seriously neglectful caregiving and adverse environments, such as 
institutions – particularly if this occurred prior to the age of 2 years. However, disinhibited 
social engagement disorder is relatively rare, and not all children or adolescents with 
a history of experiencing such environments go on to develop disinhibited social 
engagement disorder.
•	 Individuals with disinhibited social engagement disorder may or may not have developed 
selective attachment to caregivers.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
As with disinhibited social engagement disorder, children with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder may display socially disinhibited behaviour. Disinhibited social engagement disorder is 
distinguished by specific behaviours with unfamiliar adults and its association with a history of 
grossly insufficient care. However, children with disinhibited social engagement disorder often 
exhibit inattention, general impulsivity and hyperactivity. Rates of attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder are elevated among children with disinhibited social engagement disorder, and both 
disorders may be diagnosed if all diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Children with a disorder of intellectual development may exhibit atypical social behaviours. 
However, these are usually consistent with the child’s general developmental level. Children with 
disorders of intellectual development are able to form selective attachments to caregivers by the 
time they have reached a developmental age of at least 9 months. Disinhibited social engagement 
disorder should only be diagnosed if it is clear that the characteristic problems in social behaviour 
are not a result of limitations in intellectual functioning.
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system, developmental anomalies and other 
conditions originating in the perinatal period
Indiscriminate social engagement may be a result of brain damage or a feature of neurological 
syndromes such as Williams syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome. These conditions are 
differentiated from disinhibited social engagement disorder by confirmatory clinical features and 
laboratory investigations, and typically by the absence of a history of grossly insufficient care.

Other specified disorder specifically associated with stress
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by stress-related symptoms that share primary clinical 
features with other disorders specifically associated with stress (e.g. occurring in specific 
association with an identifiable stressor).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
grouping of disorders specifically associated with stress or for acute stress reaction.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a mood 
disorder or an anxiety or fear-related disorder).
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and are not due to the 
effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal 
effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.

Acute stress reaction
Note: acute stress reaction is not considered to be a mental disorder but rather appears in 
Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services. It is listed here to 
assist in differential diagnosis.
Essential (required) features
•	 Exposure to an event or situation (either short- or long-lasting) of an extremely threatening 
or horrific nature is required for diagnosis. Such events include, but are not limited to, 
directly experiencing natural or human-made disasters, combat, serious accidents, torture,

sexual violence, terrorism; assault, acute life-threatening illness (e.g. a heart attack); 
witnessing the threatened or actual injury or death of others in a sudden, unexpected, or 
violent manner; and learning about the sudden, unexpected or violent death of a loved one.
•	 There is a response to the stressor that is considered to be normal, given the severity of the 
stressor. The response to the stressor may include transient emotional, somatic, cognitive or 
behavioural symptoms, such as being in a daze, confusion, sadness, anxiety, anger, despair, 
overactivity, inactivity, social withdrawal, amnesia, depersonalization, derealization or 
stupor. Autonomic signs of anxiety (e.g. tachycardia, sweating, flushing) are common, and 
may be the presenting feature.
•	 Symptoms typically appear within hours to days following the stressful event, and usually 
begin to subside within a few days after the event or following removal from the threatening 
situation, when this is possible. In cases where the stressor is ongoing or removal is not 
possible, symptoms may persist, but are usually greatly reduced within approximately 
1 month as the person adapts to the changed situation.
Additional clinical features
•	 Acute stress reaction in help-seeking individuals is usually, but not necessarily, accompanied 
by substantial subjective distress and/or interference with personal functioning.
Developmental presentations
•	 In children, responses to stressful events can include somatic symptoms (e.g. stomach 
pains or headaches), disruptive or oppositional behaviour, regression, hyperactivity, 
tantrums, concentration problems, irritability, withdrawal, excessive daydreaming, 
increased clinginess, bedwetting and sleep disturbances. In adolescents, responses can 
include substance use and various forms of acting out or risk-taking.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder
If symptoms have not begun to diminish within about 1 week of the stressor ceasing (or within 
about 1 month in the case of continuing stressors), a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder or 
post-traumatic stress disorder should be considered, depending on the nature of the symptoms.
Disorders specifically associated with stress | Other specified or unspecified disorder specifically associated with stress

Disorders specifically associated with stress
Boundary with acute and transient psychotic disorder
Acute and transient psychotic disorder, like acute stress reaction, has an acute onset and may 
occur in response to a traumatic experience. Acute stress reaction does not typically include 
psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions that are characteristic of acute and 
transient psychotic disorder.
Boundary with other mental disorders
The symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for another mental disorder, such as 
acute and transient psychotic disorder, a depressive disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder, 
or a dissociative disorder.

Dissociative neurological symptom disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Involuntary disruption or discontinuity in the normal integration of motor, sensory or 
cognitive functions, lasting at least several hours, is required for diagnosis.
•	 Clinical findings are not consistent with a recognized disease of the nervous system (e.g. a 
stroke) or another medical condition (e.g. a head injury).
•	 The symptoms do not occur exclusively during episodes of trance disorder, possession 
trance disorder, dissociative identity disorder or partial dissociative identity disorder.
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (including withdrawal effects), do not occur exclusively during hypnagogic or 
hypnopompic states, and are not due to a sleep-wake disorder (e.g. sleep-related rhythmic 
movement disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder).
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Symptom specifiers
Specific presenting symptoms in dissociative neurological symptom disorder may be identified 
using the following symptom specifiers. Multiple specifiers may be assigned as necessary to 
describe the clinical presentation.

and do not result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. Such transient experiences should 
not be considered as symptomatic of dissociative neurological symptom disorder.
•	 Experiences resembling dissociative neurological symptom disorder can occur as a 
part of culturally sanctioned rituals, and in some cases can persist for several months 
(e.g. following a death). If such presentations are not associated with impairment in 
functioning, a diagnosis of dissociative neurological symptom disorder should not be 
assigned. Depending on the nature of the circumstances preceding the onset of symptoms, 
and their duration, acute stress reaction may be considered.
Course features
•	 Onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder typically occurs between puberty 
and early adulthood; although onset in early childhood (as young as the age of 3 years) has 
been observed, it is extremely rare. Onset after the age of 35 years is uncommon.
•	 The onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder is usually acute, and the disorder 
may follow either a transient or a persistent course. Symptoms are typically of brief duration 
(e.g. remission within 2 weeks) but commonly recur.
•	 Onset is often associated with a traumatic or adverse life event. Prior physical injury and a 
history of childhood abuse or neglect are risk factors for dissociative neurological symptom 
disorder. In addition, a prior disease of the nervous system is a risk factor for the disorder; 
for example, individuals with a history of epilepsy are more likely to exhibit non-epileptic 
seizures. Patients may also present with symptoms that closely resemble the symptoms of 
physical illnesses experienced by their friends or family members.
•	 Non-epileptic seizures are more likely to have their onset earlier in the lifespan than 
motor symptoms.
•	 Positive prognostic factors include younger age, acute onset, onset associated with a clearly 
identifiable stressor, early diagnosis, monosymptomatic presentation, short duration of 
symptoms, and short interval between symptom onset and initiation of treatment. Patients 
with good premorbid adjustment and above-average intelligence, and those who accept 
the psychological nature of the disorder also have a better prognosis. Negative prognostic 
factors include non-transient symptoms, polysymptomatic presentation, the presence of 
comorbid medical conditions and co-occurring mental disorders (e.g. mood disorders or 
anxiety and fear-related disorders). Patients with maladaptive personality traits, history of 
sexual abuse or poor physical functioning prior to diagnosis also have a poorer prognosis.
•	 Individuals with symptoms of paralysis, aphonia, blindness or deafness tend to have a 
better prognosis than those with symptoms of tremor or non-epileptic seizures.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of dissociative neurological symptom disorder in childhood is often associated with 
minor illness or physical injury.
Dissociative disorders |  Dissociative neurological symptom disorder

Dissociative disorders
•	 Gait disturbances and non-epileptic seizures are the most prominent and the most frequent 
symptoms of dissociative neurological symptom disorder in children and adolescents. 
The range and number of symptoms observed often expands with age and duration of 
the disorder.
•	 The most common psychosocial stressors associated with dissociative neurological 
symptom disorder in children include bullying or victimization, school-related stressors, 
family conflict or parental separation, and the death of a relative or friend.
•	 Individuals with dissociative neurological symptom disorder often grow up in families that 
are excessively preoccupied with illness.
•	 Adolescents with dissociative neurological symptom disorder frequently have co-occurring 
mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and other medical symptoms. 
Mood and/or anxiety and fear-related disorders often persist even after remission of the 
symptoms of dissociative neurological symptom disorder. Among adolescents, dissociative 
neurological symptom disorder is more likely to be transient.
Culture-related features
•	 Symptoms of dissociative neurological symptom disorder that are typical in one cultural 
context may be considered unusual in another, such as localized heat sensations, “peppery” 
feelings on the skin, and sensations of being touched or pushed. These symptoms may be 
connected to local expressions of distress that reference cultural explanations of etiology 
(e.g. spiritual origins) or pathophysiology (e.g. subtle energies). Alternatively, in some 
cultures, dissociative symptoms may be attributed to an undiagnosed physical illness, 
such as occurs in hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder); response to reassurance may 
suggest hypochondriasis rather than a dissociative disorder.
•	 Dissociative seizures and convulsions tend to have higher prevalence in low- and middle-
income countries and communities. Variations in prevalence may reflect greater traumatic 
exposure, sanctions against verbal expressions of disagreement by people with marginalized 
status, or cultures in which somatic expressions of distress are more common. Lower 
prevalence of dissociative symptoms may be related to negative cultural views of such “out-
of-control” behaviour.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Dissociative neurological symptom disorder is 2–3 times more frequently diagnosed 
among females, who also have a younger age of onset.
•	 In men, dissociative neurological symptom disorder is associated with a history of 
industrial, military or other occupational accident. In women, symptoms are more often 
linked to stress caused by family or other interpersonal interactions.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with dissociative amnesia
Dissociative amnesia involves memory deficits that manifest as an inability to recall important 
autobiographical memories – typically of recent traumatic or stressful events. The memory deficits 
are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting, and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or a 
disease of the nervous system. If cognitive symptoms are narrowly focused on autobiographical 
memory, dissociative amnesia is the more appropriate diagnosis. Cognitive symptoms presented 
in dissociative neurological symptom disorder involve other cognitive phenomena.
Boundary with other dissociative disorders
Dissociative motor, sensory or cognitive symptoms are commonly a part of the clinical 
presentation of trance disorder, possession trance disorder, dissociative identity disorder and 
partial dissociative identity disorder. A separate diagnosis of dissociative neurological symptom 
disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur exclusively during symptomatic episodes 
of another dissociative disorder.
Boundary with factitious disorder and malingering
In dissociative neurological symptom disorder, despite the presented symptoms (e.g. seizures, 
paralysis) not being consistent with neurological findings or other pathophysiology, the symptoms 
are not feigned, falsified or intentionally induced as in factitious disorder or malingering.
Boundary with other mental disorders
Somatic symptoms that are not consistent with an identified medical condition also occur in 
bodily distress disorder, and a variety of somatic symptoms may also occur in schizophrenia and 
other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, obsessive-
compulsive and related disorders, and disorders specifically associated with stress. Dissociative 
neurological symptom disorder should not be diagnosed if the symptoms are accounted for by 
another mental disorder.
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system and other medical conditions 
classified elsewhere
The diagnosis of dissociative neurological symptom disorder requires a medical evaluation to rule 
out diseases of the nervous system and other medical conditions as the cause of the presenting 
motor, sensory or cognitive symptoms. In dissociative neurological symptom disorder, clinical and 
laboratory findings are inconsistent with recognized symptoms of diseases of the nervous system 
or other medical conditions as indicated by an alternative examination method (e.g. normal 
simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) during an apparent seizure or convulsion).
Dissociative disorders |  Dissociative neurological symptom disorder

Dissociative disorders
Dissociative amnesia
Essential (required) features
•	 Inability to recall important autobiographical memories – typically of recent traumatic or 
stressful events – that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting is required for diagnosis.
•	 The memory loss does not occur exclusively during episodes of trance disorder, possession 
trance disorder, dissociative identity disorder or partial dissociative identity disorder, and 
is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder, 
complex post-traumatic stress disorder, a neurocognitive disorder such as dementia).
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system (e.g. alcohol) – including withdrawal effects – and are not due to a disease 
of the nervous system (e.g. temporal lobe epilepsy), another medical condition (e.g. a brain 
tumour) or head trauma.
•	 The memory loss results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Presence or absence of dissociative fugue
Dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue
•	 Dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue is characterized by all the features of 
dissociative amnesia, accompanied by dissociative fugue – i.e. a loss of a sense of personal 
identity and sudden travel away from home, work or significant others for an extended 
period of time (days or weeks).
Dissociative amnesia without dissociative fugue
•	 Dissociative amnesia without dissociative fugue is characterized by all the features of 
dissociative amnesia occurring in the absence of symptoms of dissociative fugue.

Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 In rare cases, amnesia may be generalized with regard to identity and life history. However, 
it is more commonly localized (i.e. failure to recall autobiographical events during a 
circumscribed period of time) or selective (i.e. failure to recall some but not all of the 
events during a circumscribed period of time). The extent of amnesia may vary over time.
•	 Individuals with dissociative amnesia may only be partly aware of their memory problems. 
Those who are aware of their memory problems may minimize the importance of these, 
and may become uncomfortable when prompted to address them.
•	 Dissociative amnesia is commonly associated with adverse life events, personal or 
interpersonal conflicts, or stress. The link between the disorder and these events, 
conflicts and stressors may not be apparent to the individual. Repeated or long-lasting 
traumatization, trauma caused by multiple perpetrators, and a close relationship with the 
perpetrator are associated with more persistent and refractory amnesia.
•	 Dissociative amnesia is commonly associated with chronic difficulty in forming and 
sustaining satisfying interpersonal relationships. The disorder may also be associated 
with self-harm, suicide attempts and other high-risk behaviours, depressive symptoms, 
depersonalization and sexual dysfunctions.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Mild difficulties remembering autobiographical events are common, especially as a result 
of normal ageing. Forgetting early childhood events is also developmentally typical. 
However, in contrast to dissociative amnesia, normal forgetting:
•	 does not typically involve sustained and extensive forgetting of substantial life episodes 
or significant personal facts;
•	 is usually reversed following reminders of forgotten episodes and personal facts;
•	 does not have its onset following stressful or traumatic events;
•	 does not result in significant impairment in functioning.
Course features
•	 Onset of dissociative amnesia is typically acute, occurring after traumatic or highly stressful 
events (e.g. war, natural disaster, maltreatment). Onset may occur immediately after the 
exposure or after a significant delay.
•	 Although dissociative amnesia has been observed across the lifespan, it is most commonly 
diagnosed in patients between 20 and 40 years of age.
•	 The interval affected by the memory loss and the duration of a given episode of dissociative 
amnesia are highly variable. In more acute cases, amnesia resolves spontaneously and 
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia

Dissociative disorders
rapidly (e.g. after a stressor is resolved), whereas in more chronic cases individuals either 
regain the ability to recall the dissociated memories slowly or never fully do. Dissociative 
amnesia with dissociative fugue is associated with a more persistent course.
•	 Although single episodes of dissociative amnesia have been reported, individuals who have 
had a single episode of dissociative amnesia may be predisposed to develop subsequent 
episodes. Most patients experience two or more episodes of dissociative amnesia.
•	 Post-traumatic stress disorder may develop after memories are regained. In such cases, 
these memories may be experienced in the form of flashbacks.
Developmental presentations
•	 Dissociative amnesia can be difficult to detect in young children, whose symptoms may 
be misinterpreted as lying, denial, inattention, absorption or developmentally appropriate 
forgetting. Therefore, assessment of amnesia in children should be based on multiple 
observations or reports from several individuals and types of observers (e.g. parents, 
teachers, other caregivers).
•	 Adults are more likely to experience dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue than 
children or adolescents.
Culture-related features
•	 In cultures with strictly defined social role expectations, dissociative amnesia may be 
associated with severe psychological stresses or conflicts (e.g. marital conflict, other family 
disturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due to restriction or oppression) rather than 
with traumatic exposures such as physical or sexual abuse.
•	 Amnesia reported after culturally accepted religious activities involving dissociative trance 
or possession should not be diagnosed as dissociative amnesia unless it is in excess of what 
is considered culturally normative, and is associated with functional impairment.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The prevalence of dissociative amnesia is similar among males and females.
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with acute stress reaction
Acute stress reaction is a response to an event or situation of an extremely threatening or horrific 
nature that is considered to be normal given the severity of the stressor. Symptoms of acute stress 
reaction may include transient amnesia for the immediate period and the event of the stressor. 
Acute stress reaction begins to subside within a few days after the event or following removal 
from the threatening situation. Dissociative amnesia should be considered as a diagnosis when 
the amnesia includes autobiographical information not directly related to the stressor, or when 
the amnestic episode lasts longer than the immediate aftermath of the stressor (i.e. from several 
hours to several days).
Boundary with memory deficits in dissociative neurological symptom disorder

Dissociative neurological symptom disorder may include a variety of cognitive symptoms that 
are not due to the direct effects of a substance or a disease of the nervous system. If cognitive 
symptoms are focused exclusively on autobiographical memory, dissociative amnesia is the more 
appropriate diagnosis.
Boundary with possession trance disorder
Amnesia may occur in possession trance disorder. However, amnesia in possession trance disorder 
is related to episodes experienced as involving the intrusion of a new identity attributed to a 
spirit, power, deity or other spiritual entity. Possession trance disorder also involves behaviours 
or movements that are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent – symptoms that 
are not typically present in dissociative amnesia.
Boundary with dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity 
disorder
Episodes of amnesia are common in dissociative identity disorder, and may also occur in partial 
dissociative identity disorder. However, amnesia in partial dissociative identity disorder is usually 
brief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm. Moreover, dissociative 
amnesia is not characterized by the experience of two or more distinct, alternate personality 
states, as is the case in dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity disorder. 
In dissociative amnesia with dissociative fugue, the individual is typically confused about their 
identity. If two or more distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the 
individual’s consciousness and functioning, which may include episodes of amnesia, dissociative 
identity disorder is the more appropriate diagnosis.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress 
disorder
In post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, memories of the 
traumatic event may be fragmented, disorganized or incomplete. When the amnesia is more 
pervasive and also involves autobiographical memories that are not related to the traumatic event, 
and the diagnostic requirements of both disorders are met, an additional diagnosis of dissociative 
amnesia may be assigned.
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia

Dissociative disorders
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Amnesia is common in disorders due to substance use – particularly alcohol-related disorders 
(e.g. “alcohol blackouts”). If amnesia occurs exclusively in the context of alcohol or drug use, 
a diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is not warranted. However, differential diagnosis may be 
complicated in cases in which an individual with a history of dissociative amnestic episodes also 
uses alcohol or other substances.
Boundary with memory deficits in neurocognitive disorders, head trauma and 
medical conditions classified elsewhere
Neurocognitive disorders – including delirium, amnestic disorder and dementia – are 
characterized by primary acquired clinical deficits in cognitive functioning, frequently including 
significant and pervasive memory impairment. In neurocognitive disorders, a specific etiological 
factor or underlying disease process can often be identified. Memory loss may also occur as a 
result of a brain injury, or as an effect of some diseases of the nervous system or medical conditions 
classified elsewhere (e.g. a brain tumour). In dissociative amnesia, memory loss is primarily 
for autobiographical memories, and no underlying disease process or injury that represents a 
potential etiology for the memory impairment can be identified.
Trance disorder and possession trance disorder
Trance disorder and possession trance disorder are characterized by recurrent or single and 
prolonged involuntary marked alteration in an individual’s state of consciousness involving 
either a trance state (without possession) or a possession trance state. The distinctive feature of 
possession trance disorder is that the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replaced 
by an external “possessing” identity attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity or other 
spiritual entity, which does not occur in trance disorder. In addition, in possession trance disorder 
a greater range of more complex behaviours may be exhibited, which are experienced as being 
controlled by the possessing agent, whereas trance disorder typically involves the repetition of a 
small repertoire of behaviours.
Most trance or possession trance states are brief and transitory, and are related to cultural and 
religious experiences. These experiences are not considered pathological, and a diagnosis should 
not be assigned based on their occurrence. Trance and possession trance states should only be 
considered to be features of a mental disorder when they are involuntary and unwanted, not 
accepted as a part of a collective cultural or religious practice, and result in significant distress or 
significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important 
areas of functioning.
Because of the substantial similarity between these disorders, following a separate listing of 
the essential (required) features of each, the other CDDR elements are provided for the two 
categories together.
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative amnesia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Trance disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Occurrence of a trance state in which there is a marked alteration in the individual’s state 
of consciousness or a loss of the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is required 
for diagnosis, characterized by both:
•	 narrowing of awareness of immediate surroundings or unusually narrow and selective 
focusing on specific environmental stimuli; and
•	 restriction of movements, postures and speech to repetition of a small repertoire that is 
experienced as being outside the individual’s control.
•	 The trance state is not characterized by the experience of being replaced by an alternate 
identity.
•	 Trance episodes are recurrent or, if the diagnosis is based on a single episode, the episode 
has lasted for at least several days.
•	 The trance state is involuntary and unwanted, and is not accepted as a part of a collective 
cultural or religious practice.
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (including withdrawal effects), to exhaustion, to hypnagogic or hypnopompic 
states, or to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex partial seizures), head trauma 
or a sleep-wake disorder.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning 
is maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Possession trance disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Occurrence of a trance state in which there is a marked alteration in the individual’s state 
of consciousness, and the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replaced by an 
external “possessing” identity, is required for diagnosis. The trance state is characterized by 
behaviours or movements that are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent.
•	 Trance episodes are attributed to the influence of an external “possessing” spirit, power, 
deity or other spiritual entity.
•	 Trance episodes are recurrent or, if the diagnosis is based on a single episode, the episode 
has lasted for at least several days.
•	 The possession trance state is involuntary and unwanted, and is not accepted as a part of a 
collective cultural or religious practice.

Dissociative disorders | Trance disorder | Possession trance disorder

Dissociative disorders
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (including withdrawal effects), to exhaustion, to hypnagogic or hypnopompic 
states, or to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex partial seizures) or a sleep-wake 
disorder.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features for trance disorder and possession trance 
disorder
•	 Trance and possession trance disorders tend to involve recurrent episodes rather than a 
persistent trance or possession trance state. To qualify for a diagnosis, a single, persistent 
trance or possession trance state must last for at least several days.
•	 Possession trance disorder is usually characterized by full or partial amnesia for the trance 
episode. Full or partial amnesia may also occur in trance disorder.
•	 The actions performed during a trance state (e.g. staring, falling) are generally not 
complex, whereas during possession trance states the activities performed are often 
more complex (e.g. coherent conversations, characteristic gestures, facial expressions, 
specific verbalizations), and are frequently culturally accepted as belonging to a particular 
possessing agent. These behaviours or movements are often stereotyped, and may reflect 
cultural influences.
•	 Presumed possessing agents in possession trance disorder are usually spiritual in nature 
(e.g. spirits of the dead, gods, demons or other spiritual entities), and are often experienced 
as making demands or expressing animosity.
Boundary with normality (threshold) for trance disorder and 
possession trance disorder
•	 A diagnosis of trance disorder or possession trance disorder should not be applied to 
experiences that are accepted in the individual’s context as collective cultural phenomena 
or as a part of religious practices. Moreover, the diagnoses should not be applied to trance 
episodes when these do not result in significant distress or impairment in functioning.
•	 Single and transitory (minutes to hours) trance or possession trance experiences that are 
mildly distressing or impairing may occur under stressful circumstances, especially in the 
context of pre-existing mood disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders. These single, 
transitory states are not a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of trance disorder or possession 
trance disorder.
Dissociative disorders | Possession trance disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features for trance disorder and possession trance disorder
•	 Prevalence of trance and possession trance disorders is highest among young adults, with 
a mean age at onset of between 20 and 25 years.
•	 The long-term course of trance and possession trance disorders is variable, ranging from a 
single prolonged episode to multiple recurrences over years.
•	 Duration and intensity of trance episodes vary considerably. Most recurrent episodes 
are brief, and individuals may fall in and out of trance states multiple times within a 
given episode.
•	 Acute recurrent episodes of trance usually last minutes to hours, and are followed by a 
period of exhaustion. Episodes of possession trance usually take longer to resolve, with 
many shifts in and out of trance states over days or even weeks.
•	 Trance states can be evoked by significant emotional stress, anger or enhanced frustration. 
Domestic disharmony, war-related trauma and interpersonal conflicts related to religious 
or cultural issues have also been shown to play a significant role in the precipitation of 
trance or possession trance states.
•	 Trance states can occur in clusters (i.e. multiple cases taking place in close temporal and/
or spatial proximity), and may be associated with mass suggestibility.
•	 Individuals with prior exposure to trance states or who are spiritual healers are at higher risk 
of developing involuntary trance states themselves, outside culturally sanctioned rituals.
•	 Patients with trance disorder and possession trance disorder often report prodromal 
symptoms. Somatic complaints and a sense of presence (i.e. feeling that one is not alone) 
are common. However, presence or absence of prodromal symptoms does not predict the 
number of trance episodes.
•	 Possession trance states are often characterized by involuntary motor movements, 
glossolalia, auditory hallucinations or amnesia. Possession trance states in which the 
individual’s sense of identity is replaced are often preceded by a phase of other, more 
passive dissociative experiences (e.g. feeling influenced by forces or spirits from the 
outside, hearing voices, being unable to speak).
Developmental presentations for trance disorder and possession 
trance disorder
•	 Trance-like states may manifest in children in various ways, including vacant staring or 
talking to themselves loudly in different voices.
•	 Adolescents characterized by nervousness, excitability and emotional instability are more 
likely to develop trance states.
Dissociative disorders | Possession trance disorder

Dissociative disorders
Cultural presentations for trance disorder and possession trance 
disorder
•	 Episodes of trance disorder and possession trance disorder have been documented in a 
wide range of cultures. Prevalence may increase as part of a collective (mass) response 
to traumatic events affecting an entire community, such as a measles epidemic. Increases 
in prevalence have also been attributed to rapid social or cultural change in the affected 
communities, possibly as an expression of distress and opposition to changing values 
and circumstances.
•	 Specific local instances of trance disorder and possession trance disorder show considerable 
variation cross-culturally regarding the behaviours during the altered state, the presence of 
dissociative sensory and motor alterations, and the identity assumed during these states. 
The identities of the possessing agents typically correspond to figures from the religious 
traditions in the society.
•	 Some individuals with trance disorder and possession trance disorder may gradually 
develop control and acceptance of the trance experience, based on participation in 
religious or cultural groups where these possession trance experiences are normative. 
Over time, these individuals do not have a higher prevalence of mental disorders than the 
general population.
Sex- and/or gender-related features for trance disorder and 
possession trance disorder
•	 The prevalence of trance disorder and possession trance disorder appears to be comparable 
among males and females.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential 
diagnosis) for trance disorder and possession trance disorder
Boundary with dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity 
disorder
Possession trance disorder involves a marked alteration in the individual’s normal sense of 
personal identity that is attributed to an external possessing agent. This is distinguished from 
dissociative identity disorder and partial dissociative identity disorder, which are characterized 
by the experience of two or more distinct, alternate personality states that are not attributed to 
an external possessing agent. Individuals describing both internally and externally attributed 
alternate identities should receive a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder or partial dissociative 
identity disorder. In this situation, an additional diagnosis of possession trance disorder should 
not be assigned.
Dissociative disorders | Possession trance disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with other dissociative disorders
A variety of dissociative symptoms may occur as a part of trance disorder or possession trance 
disorder, including dissociative amnesia, sensory or motor symptoms, depersonalization and 
derealization. However, these should not be considered a basis for a separate diagnosis of an 
additional dissociative disorder when they occur solely during the trance or possession trance 
state. Symptoms that persist after the trance or possession trance state has ended may be 
considered a basis for a co-occurring diagnosis of the corresponding dissociative disorder.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Intrusive symptoms of possession trance disorder such as hearing voices, insertion of feelings 
and thoughts, or exhibiting behaviours attributed to the possessing agent are distinguished from 
symptoms of schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders because they occur primarily 
during the possession trance state, and are usually of brief duration. Possession trance disorder is 
also distinguished from schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder by the absence of other types 
of positive psychotic symptoms or of negative symptoms.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder may include flashbacks 
or other dissociative trance-like states characterized by narrowing of awareness of immediate 
surroundings and re-experiencing of the traumatic experience as though it were happening again 
in the here and now. These episodes are generally not experienced as under the person’s voluntary 
control. If trance-like states are limited to episodes of re-experiencing in the context of post-
traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, an additional diagnosis of 
trance disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with delirium
Delirium and trance disorder may both present with transient and marked alteration in the 
individual’s state of consciousness, but delirium typically presents as significant confusion or 
global cognitive impairment. In contrast, trance disorder is characterized by a loss of a normal 
sense of personal identity, narrowing of awareness and restriction of behaviour. Unlike trance 
disorder, delirium is typically attributable to the direct physiological effects of a medical condition 
and/or a substance or medication, including withdrawal.
Boundary with epilepsy
Individuals with trance disorder may exhibit features resembling focal unaware (partial complex) 
seizures, but have normal EEGs even during trance episodes.
Dissociative identity disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Disruption of identity characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality 
states (dissociative identities), involving marked discontinuities in the sense of self and 
agency, is required for diagnosis. Each personality state includes its own pattern of 
experiencing, perceiving, conceiving and relating to self, the body and the environment.
6B64
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative identity disorder

Dissociative disorders
•	 At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual’s 
consciousness and functioning in interacting with others or with the environment, such as 
in the performance of specific aspects of daily life (e.g. parenting, work), or in response to 
specific situations (e.g. those that are perceived as threatening).
•	 Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, 
perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor control and behaviour. There are typically 
episodes of amnesia inconsistent with ordinary forgetting, which may be severe.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder).
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system – including withdrawal effects – (e.g. blackouts or chaotic behaviour during 
substance intoxication), and are not due to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex 
partial seizures) or to a sleep-wake disorder (e.g. symptoms occur during hypnagogic or 
hypnopompic states).
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 Alternation between distinct personality states is not always associated with amnesia. 
That is, one personality state may have awareness and recollection of the activities of 
another personality state during a particular episode. However, substantial episodes of 
amnesia are typically present at some point during the course of the disorder.
•	 In individuals with dissociative identity disorder, it is common for one personality 
state to be “intruded upon” by aspects of other non-dominant, alternate personality 
states without their taking executive control, as in partial dissociative identity disorder. 
These intrusions may involve a range of features, including cognitive (intruding thoughts), 
affective (intruding affects such as fear, anger or shame), perceptual (e.g. intruding voices 
or fleeting visual perceptions), sensory (e.g. intruding sensations such as being touched, 
pain or altered perceived size of the body or of part of the body), motor (e.g. involuntary 
movements of an arm and hand) and behavioural (e.g. an action that lacks a sense of 
agency or ownership) features. The personality state that is intruded upon in this way 
commonly experiences the intrusions as aversive, and may or may not realize that the 
intrusions relate to features of other personality states.
•	 Dissociative identity disorder is commonly associated with serious or chronic traumatic 
life events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The presence of two or more distinct personality states does not always indicate the 
presence of a mental disorder. In certain circumstances (e.g. as experienced by “mediums” 
or other culturally accepted spiritual practitioners), the presence of multiple personality 
states is not experienced as aversive, and is not associated with impairment in functioning. 
A diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder should not be assigned in these cases.
Dissociative disorders | Possession trance disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
•	 Onset of dissociative identity disorder is most commonly associated with traumatic 
experiences – especially physical, sexual and emotional abuse or childhood neglect. The 
onset of identity changes can also be triggered by removal from ongoing traumatizing 
circumstances, by death or serious illness of the perpetrator of abuse, or by other unrelated 
traumatic experiences later in life.
•	 Dissociative identity disorder usually has a recurrent and fluctuating clinical course.
•	 Some individuals remain highly impaired in most aspects of functioning, despite treatment. 
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are at high risk of self-injurious behaviour 
and suicide attempts.
•	 Although symptoms can remit spontaneously with age, recurrence may occur during 
periods of increased stress.
•	 Recurrent or chronic ongoing traumatic experiences are associated with poorer prognosis.
•	 Dissociative identity disorder often co-occurs with other mental disorders. In such cases, 
identity alternations can influence the symptom presentation of the co-occurring disorders.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of dissociative identity disorder can occur across the lifespan. Initial identity changes 
usually appear at an early age, but dissociative identities are not typically fully developed. 
Instead, children present with discontinuities of experience and marked interference 
among mental states.
•	 Identification of dissociative identity disorder in children can be difficult because 
symptoms manifest in a variety of ways that overlap with other mental disorders, including 
those involving conduct problems, mood and anxiety symptoms, learning difficulties and 
auditory hallucinations. Young children often project their dissociated identities onto toys 
or other objects, so that abnormalities in their identity may only become detectable as 
children age and their behaviours become less developmentally appropriate. With adequate 
treatment, children with dissociative identity disorder tend to have a better prognosis 
than adults.
•	 Early identity changes in adolescence characteristic of dissociative identity disorder may 
be mistaken for developmentally typical difficulties with emotional and behavioural 
regulation.
•	 Older patients with dissociative identity disorder may present with what appears to be 
late-life onset paranoia or cognitive impairment, or atypical mood, psychotic or obsessive-
compulsive symptoms.
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative identity disorder

Dissociative disorders
Culture-related features
•	 Features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual’s cultural 
background. For example, individuals may present with dissociative symptoms of 
movement, behaviour or cognition – such as non-epileptic seizures and convulsions, 
paralyses or sensory loss – in sociocultural settings where such symptoms are common. 
These symptoms typically remain persistent and debilitating until the underlying 
dissociative identity disorder is identified and treated.
•	 Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the 
dissociative identities; for example, identities in India may speak English exclusively and 
wear Western clothes as a sign of their difference from the usual personality state.
•	 In some societies, presentations of dissociative identity disorder may occur after stressful 
exposures (e.g. recurrent parental affect dysregulation), which may or may not involve 
physical or sexual abuse. The tendency towards dissociative responses to stressors may be 
increased in cultures with less individualistic (“bounded”) conceptions of the self, or in 
circumstances of socioeconomic deprivation.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Prior to puberty, prevalence of dissociative identity disorder does not appear to vary by 
gender. After puberty, prevalence appears to be higher among females.
•	 Significant gender differences have been observed in the symptoms of dissociative identity 
disorder across the lifespan. Females with dissociative identity disorder often present 
with more dissociative identities, and tend to experience more acute dissociative states 
(e.g. amnesia, conversion symptoms, self-mutilation). Males with dissociative identity 
disorder are more likely to deny their symptoms or to exhibit violent or criminal behaviours.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with trance disorder and possession trance disorder
Trance disorder is not characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states. 
In possession trance disorder, the individual’s customary sense of personal identity is replaced 
by an external “possessing” identity, which is attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity 
or other spiritual entity. Behaviours or movements are experienced as being controlled by the 
possessing agent. Individuals who describe both internal distinct personality states that assume 
executive control and episodes of being controlled by an external possessing identity should 
receive a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder rather than possession trance disorder.
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative identity disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with partial dissociative identity disorder
In dissociative identity disorder, discontinuities in agency and sense of self are marked (manifested 
in episodes of executive control, often including amnesia, and greater elaboration of the personality 
states), whereas in partial dissociative identity disorder these discontinuities are less pronounced. 
In partial dissociative identity disorder, one personality state is dominant and functions in daily 
life (e.g. parenting, work), but is intruded upon by non-dominant personality states (dissociative 
intrusions). Unlike in dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant personality states do 
not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the 
extent that they perform in specific aspects of daily life (e.g. parenting, work). However, in partial 
dissociative identity disorder, there may be occasional, limited and transient episodes in which 
a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage in circumscribed behaviours 
(e.g. in response to extreme emotional states, episodes of self-harm or the re-enactment of 
traumatic memories). In partial dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant personality 
states are not elaborated to the extent observed in dissociative identity disorder. For example, 
they may not be oriented to the present, may have the identity of a child, or may be mostly or 
exclusively involved in re-enacting traumatic memories. In addition, there are typically (although 
not always) significant episodes of amnesia in dissociative identity disorder, which may be severe. 
In contrast, episodes of amnesia in partial dissociative identity disorder – if present – are typically 
brief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm.
Boundary with other dissociative disorders
Dissociative identity disorder is distinguished from other dissociative disorders by the presence 
of two distinct personality states that recurrently take executive control of the individual’s 
consciousness and functioning. This does not occur in any other dissociative disorder (except 
possibly for limited circumstances in partial dissociative identity disorder, as described above). 
An additional dissociative disorder diagnosis should not be assigned based on phenomena that 
occur in specific relationship to changes in personality states (e.g. memory loss, changes in motor 
or sensory functioning, experiences of depersonalization and derealization).
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may report experiencing symptoms such as hearing 
voices or intrusive thoughts that may also occur in schizophrenia and other primary psychotic 
disorders. However, individuals with dissociative identity disorder do not typically exhibit 
delusions, formal thought disorder or negative symptoms (as in schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
disorder), or rapid-onset and rapidly fluctuating symptoms (as in acute and transient psychotic 
disorder). In the absence of other symptoms supporting a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another 
primary psychotic disorder, intrusive phenomena such as hearing voices may suggest the presence 
of dissociative personality states.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder 
may experience alterations in identity and sense of agency during episodes of re-experiencing 
of traumatic events (e.g. during flashbacks). For example, they may feel that they are unable to 
control their experiences or reactions during the re-experiencing episode, or that they are in 
a different time in their own lives. However, these episodes are not characterized by a distinct 
personality state taking executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning. 
Because dissociative identity disorder is commonly associated with serious or chronic traumatic 
life events, it may co-occur with post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress 
disorder, and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Dissociative disorders | Dissociative identity disorder

Dissociative disorders
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g. of contamination), 
images (e.g. of violent scenes) or impulses/urges (e.g. to stab someone) that are experienced as 
intrusive and unwanted (obsessions), as well as repetitive behaviours – including repetitive mental 
acts – that the individual feels driven to perform (compulsions). However, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder is not characterized by discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, or the presence of 
two or more distinct personality states.
Boundary with personality disorder
Personality disorder, particularly with borderline pattern, is characterized by persistent 
disturbances in sense of identity and self-direction, and often by problems with affect regulation. 
Personality disorder does not involve the presence of two or more distinct personality states, 
but some individuals with severe personality disorder exhibit transient dissociative experiences 
during times of stress or intense emotion.
Partial dissociative identity disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Disruption of identity characterized by the experience of two or more distinct personality 
states (dissociative identities), involving discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, is 
required for diagnosis. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, 
perceiving, conceiving and relating to self, the body and the environment.
•	 One personality state is dominant and functions in daily life (e.g. parenting, work), but is 
intruded upon by one or more non-dominant personality states (dissociative intrusions). 
These intrusions may be cognitive (intruding thoughts), affective (intruding affects such 
as fear, anger or shame), perceptual (e.g. intruding voices, fleeting visual perceptions, 
sensations such as being touched), motor (e.g. involuntary movements of an arm) or 
behavioural (e.g. an action that lacks a sense of agency or ownership). These experiences 
are experienced as interfering with the functioning of the dominant personality state and 
are typically aversive.
•	 The non-dominant personality states do not recurrently take executive control of the 
individual’s consciousness and functioning to the extent that they perform in specific 
aspects of daily life (e.g. parenting, work). However, there may be occasional, limited and 
transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage 
in circumscribed behaviours (e.g. in response to extreme emotional states or during 
episodes of self-harm or the re-enactment of traumatic memories).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder).
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system – including withdrawal effects – (e.g. blackouts or chaotic behaviour during 
substance intoxication), and are not due to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex 
partial seizures) or to a sleep-wake disorder (e.g. symptoms occur during hypnagogic or 
hypnopompic states).
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.

Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 The dissociative intrusions attributed to non-dominant personality states by individuals 
with partial dissociative identity disorder are experienced internally, and may not be 
obvious to observers. Observable identity alteration is typically indicative of dissociative 
identity disorder.
•	 Individuals with partial dissociative identity disorder often do not experience amnesia 
during episodes of dissociative intrusions. If amnesia does occur, it is usually brief and 
restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm.
•	 Partial dissociative identity disorder is commonly associated with serious or chronic 
traumatic life events, including physical, sexual or emotional abuse.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The presence of distinct personality states or dissociative intrusions does not always 
indicate the presence of a mental disorder. In certain circumstances (e.g. as experienced by 
“mediums” or other culturally accepted spiritual practitioners), the presence of multiple 
personality states is not experienced as aversive and is not associated with impairment in 
functioning. A diagnosis of partial dissociative identity disorder should not be assigned in 
these cases.
Course features
•	 Partial dissociative identity disorder is strongly linked to traumatic experiences – especially 
physical, sexual and emotional abuse or childhood neglect. The onset of identity changes 
can also be triggered by removal from ongoing traumatizing circumstances, by death or 
serious illness of the perpetrator of abuse, or by other unrelated traumatic experiences 
later in life.
•	 Partial dissociative identity disorder usually has a recurrent and fluctuating clinical course. 
Although symptoms might reduce spontaneously with age in older adults, periods of 
increased stress can cause recurrence of symptoms. Factors such as re-traumatization or 
chronically ongoing abuse tend to predict a poorer prognosis.
•	 Partial dissociative identity disorder often co-occurs with other mental disorders. 
In such cases, identity alternations can influence the symptom presentation of the 
co-occurring disorders.
Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder

Dissociative disorders
Developmental presentations
•	 Disorganized attachment in childhood might put individuals at risk of developing partial 
dissociative identity disorder later in life.
•	 The onset of partial dissociative identity disorder may occur at any stage of life, from early 
childhood to late adulthood.
•	 Diagnosis in pre-adolescent children might be particularly challenging, as partial 
dissociative identity disorder in children can manifest in a variety of ways, including 
conduct problems, mood and anxiety symptoms, learning difficulties or what appear to 
be auditory hallucinations. Also, young children often project their dissociated identities 
onto toys or other objects, so that abnormalities in their identity may become detectable 
only as children age and their behaviours become less developmentally appropriate. Given 
adequate treatment, children with partial dissociative identity disorder tend to have a 
better prognosis than adults.
•	 Early identity changes in adolescence characteristic of partial dissociative identity disorder 
may be mistaken for developmentally typical difficulties with emotional and behavioural 
regulation.
•	 Older patients with partial dissociative identity disorder may present with what appears 
to be late-life paranoia, cognitive dysfunction, atypical mood, psychotic symptoms or 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
Culture-related features
•	 Features of partial dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual’s 
cultural background. For example, individuals may present with dissociative symptoms 
of movement, behaviour or cognition – such as non-epileptic seizures and convulsions, 
paralyses or sensory loss – in sociocultural settings where such symptoms are common.
•	 In some societies, presentations of partial dissociative identity disorder may occur after 
stressful exposures (e.g. recurrent parental affect dysregulation), which may or may not 
involve physical or sexual abuse. The tendency towards dissociative responses to stressors 
may be increased in cultures with less individualistic (“bounded”) conceptions of the self, 
or in circumstances of socioeconomic deprivation.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Females appear to be more likely to experience identity intrusions.
Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with trance disorder and possession trance disorder
Some dissociative intrusions in partial dissociative identity disorder may resemble trance states, 
but trance disorder is not characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states. 
In possession trance disorder, the individual’s normal sense of personal identity is replaced by an 
external “possessing” identity, which is attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity or other 
spiritual entity. Behaviours or movements are experienced as being controlled by the possessing 
agent. Individuals who experience dissociative intrusions attributed to both internal and external 
entities should receive a diagnosis of partial dissociative identity disorder rather than possession 
trance disorder.
Boundary with dissociative identity disorder
In dissociative identity disorder, discontinuities in agency and sense of self are marked (manifested 
in episodes of executive control – often including amnesia – and greater elaboration of the 
personality states), whereas in partial dissociative identity disorder, these discontinuities are less 
pronounced. In dissociative identity disorder, two or more distinct personality states recurrently 
take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the extent that they 
function in daily life or engage in relatively elaborate patterns of behaviour in specific situations. 
In contrast, in partial dissociative identity disorder, the non-dominant, alternate personality states 
do not recurrently take executive control of the individual’s consciousness and functioning to the 
extent that they perform in specific aspects of daily life, although there may be occasional, limited 
and transient episodes in which a distinct personality state assumes executive control to engage 
in circumscribed behaviours (e.g. in response to extreme emotional states, episodes of self-harm 
or the re-enactment of traumatic memories). In partial dissociative identity disorder, the non-
dominant alternate personality states are not elaborated to the extent observed in dissociative 
identity disorder. For example, they may not be oriented to the present, may have the identity of a 
child, or may be mostly or exclusively involved in re-enacting traumatic memories. Furthermore, 
in dissociative identity disorder there are typically (although not always) significant episodes of 
amnesia, which may be severe. In partial dissociative identity disorder, amnesia – if present – is 
usually brief and restricted to extreme emotional states or episodes of self-harm.
Boundary with other dissociative disorders
Partial dissociative identity disorder is distinguished from other dissociative disorders by the 
presence of two or more distinct personality states. This does not occur in any other dissociative 
disorder (except dissociative identity disorder, as described above). An additional dissociative 
disorder diagnosis should not be assigned based on phenomena that occur in specific relationship 
to intrusions by non-dominant personality states (e.g. memory loss, changes in motor or sensory 
functioning, experiences of depersonalization and derealization).
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Individuals with partial dissociative identity disorder may report experiencing symptoms such 
as hearing voices or intrusive thoughts that may also occur in schizophrenia and other primary 
psychotic disorders. However, individuals with partial dissociative identity disorder do not 
typically exhibit delusions, formal thought disorder or negative symptoms, or rapid-onset and 
rapidly fluctuating symptoms (as in acute and transient psychotic disorder). In the absence 
of other symptoms supporting a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic 
disorder, intrusive phenomena such as hearing voices may suggest the presence of dissociative 
personality states.
Dissociative disorders | Partial dissociative identity disorder

Dissociative disorders
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder involves repetitive and persistent thoughts (e.g. of contamination), 
images (e.g. of violent scenes) or impulses/urges (e.g. to stab someone) that are experienced as 
intrusive and unwanted (obsessions), as well as repetitive behaviours – including repetitive mental 
acts that the individual feels driven to perform (compulsions). However, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder is not characterized by discontinuities in the sense of self and agency, or the presence of 
two or more distinct personality states.
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Partial dissociative identity disorder involves pervasive alterations in identity and sense of agency. 
In post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, such alterations can 
occur but are limited to episodes of re-experiencing traumatic events (e.g. during flashbacks). If 
symptoms consistent with dissociative intrusions occur exclusively during such episodes in the 
context of post-traumatic stress disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, an additional 
diagnosis of partial dissociative identity disorder is not warranted.
Boundary with personality disorder
Personality disorder, particularly with borderline pattern, is characterized by persistent 
disturbances in sense of identity and self-direction, and often by problems with affect regulation. 
Personality disorder does not involve the presence of two or more distinct personality states, 
but some individuals with severe personality disorder exhibit transient dissociative experiences 
during times of stress or intense emotion.
Depersonalization-derealization disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Persistent or recurrent experiences of either depersonalization or derealization, or of both 
symptoms, are required for diagnosis.
•	 Depersonalization is characterized by experiencing the self as strange or unreal, or by 
feeling detached from – or as though one were an outside observer of – one’s thoughts, 
feelings, sensations, body or actions. Depersonalization may take the form of emotional 
and/or physical numbing, a sense of watching oneself from a distance or “being in a play”, 
or perceptual alterations (e.g. a distorted sense of time).
•	 Derealization is characterized by experiencing other people, objects or the world as strange 
or unreal (e.g. dreamlike, distant, foggy, lifeless, colourless or visually distorted), or by 
feeling detached from one’s surroundings.
•	 During experiences of depersonalization or derealization, reality testing remains intact. 
The experiences are not associated with delusions or beliefs that the individual is being 
controlled by external people or forces.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. post-
traumatic stress disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder, another dissociative disorder, 
personality disorder).
6B66
Dissociative disorders | Depersonalization-derealization disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system (including withdrawal effects) and are not due to a disease of the nervous system 
(e.g. temporal lobe epilepsy), head trauma or another medical condition.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features
•	 A common associated symptom in depersonalization-derealization disorder is an altered 
sense of time, such as the subjective experience of time slowing down or speeding up.
•	 Catastrophic cognitions (e.g. frequent fears of “going crazy”) may occur, along with a 
lack of vividness in autobiographical memories. Loss of the sense of “ownership” of some 
memories or physiological hyporeactivity to emotional stimuli may also be present.
•	 Episodes of depersonalization and derealization in depersonalization-derealization 
disorder may be associated with adverse life events or interpersonal conflicts.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Transient feelings of depersonalization or derealization may be experienced when under 
stress, during extreme emotional states or exhaustion, when physically ill, or under the 
influence of substances. Unlike depersonalization-derealization disorder, such experiences 
typically remit when these emotional or physical states change.
Course features
•	 Onset of depersonalization-derealization disorder can occur in childhood, but more 
typically has its onset in mid-adolescence, with a mean age at onset of approximately 16 
years. Onset after 25 years of age is very rare.
•	 The onset of depersonalization-derealization disorder can vary from acute to gradual and 
insidious, with initial episodes of limited severity and frequency followed by episodes that 
are more extreme and persistent.
•	 Discrete episodes of depersonalization-derealization disorder can vary in duration, 
ranging from brief (e.g. hours or days) to prolonged (e.g. weeks, months or years). The 
course of the disorder is typically chronic and persistent.
•	 Most patients experience either continuous symptoms or an initially episodic course that 
becomes continuous over time. A persistent episodic course is less common, affecting 
about one third of cases. Intensity of symptoms may differ between episodes or remain 
constant for years or even decades.
Dissociative disorders | Depersonalization-derealization disorder

Dissociative disorders
•	 Internal and external factors such as emotional stress, anxiety or negative affect, sensory 
overstimulation, sleep deprivation or substance use can exacerbate symptom intensity. 
Some individuals with depersonalization-derealization disorder report that physical 
stimulation (e.g. exercise, mild self-injury) or comforting interpersonal interactions can 
reduce symptom intensity.
•	 Depersonalization-derealization disorder often co-occurs with mood disorders, anxiety 
and fear-related disorders or personality disorder. However, co-occurrence of these 
diagnoses does not appear to alter the severity of depersonalization or derealization 
symptoms.
•	 Although a history of verbal or emotional abuse, neglect and other forms of childhood 
interpersonal trauma are associated with the development of depersonalization-
derealization disorder, the association is not as strong as for other dissociative disorders 
(e.g. dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder). Some cases of depersonalization-
derealization disorder develop with what appears to be an onset “out of the blue” that 
cannot be linked to any identifiable triggers.
•	 Psychoactive substance use, especially of marijuana or hallucinogens, is a common 
precipitant of depersonalization and derealization symptoms. However, depersonalization-
derealization disorder diagnosis can only be assigned if the symptoms persist beyond the 
period of intoxication or withdrawal.
Developmental presentations
•	 Children often have significant difficulty verbalizing their subjective experiences of 
depersonalization or derealization. They are also less likely than adults to experience 
unease or distress caused by these symptoms.
•	 Depersonalization in adolescents may lead to poor academic achievement.
Culture-related features
•	 Intentionally induced experiences of depersonalization and derealization can be desired 
objectives of spiritual or meditative practices that are common in many religions and 
cultures, and should not be assigned a diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization 
disorder. Transient distressing experiences of depersonalization and derealization may 
emerge initially during these practices, but abate as the person acquires proficiency.
•	 However, some individuals who initially induce these states intentionally or experience 
them as part of their religious practice may lose control over them and develop persistent 
symptoms that warrant assigning the diagnosis.
Dissociative disorders | Depersonalization-derealization disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Depersonalization-derealization disorder occurs with similar frequency among men and 
women, with similar clinical characteristics.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with other dissociative disorders
Experiences of depersonalization and derealization are common in other dissociative disorders – 
particularly dissociative identity disorder, partial dissociative identity disorder, trance disorder 
and possession trance disorder. If the diagnostic requirements for another dissociative disorder are 
met, an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
In schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, non-transient experiences of 
depersonalization or derealization are common during psychotic episodes, and may be 
accompanied by delusional interpretations of this experience. If depersonalization and/or 
derealization are limited to periods of psychotic symptoms in an individual with schizophrenia or 
another primary psychotic disorder, an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization 
disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with depressive disorders
Depersonalization and derealization are common during depressive episodes, and may be 
persistent. An additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be 
assigned if the symptoms occur only during depressive episodes, or are otherwise better accounted 
for by a depressive disorder.
Boundary with panic attacks
Panic attacks in the context of panic disorder or other mental disorders may be associated with 
marked experiences of depersonalization-derealization, which may persist for a time after the panic 
episode subsides. If depersonalization-derealization symptoms occur exclusively during panic 
attacks or continue only for a brief period afterwards, a separate diagnosis of depersonalization-
derealization disorder is not warranted.
Boundary with other anxiety and fear-related disorders
Transient experiences of depersonalization or derealization are also common in other anxiety 
and fear-related disorders such as social anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. 
If depersonalization and/or derealization is better accounted for by an anxiety or fear-related 
disorder (for example, these experiences occur only in the context of confrontation with the 
corresponding focus of apprehension), an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization 
disorder should not be assigned.
Dissociative disorders | Depersonalization-derealization disorder

Dissociative disorders
Boundary with post-traumatic stress disorder and complex post-traumatic 
stress disorder
Experiences of depersonalization and derealization are common in post-traumatic stress 
disorder, particularly during re-experiencing episodes such as flashbacks. If depersonalization or 
derealization is limited to episodes of re-experiencing in an individual with post-traumatic stress 
disorder or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-
derealization disorder should not be assigned. However, if clinically significant depersonalization 
and derealization occurs outside or is persistent following re-experiencing episodes, and the 
diagnostic requirements of both disorders are met, an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-
derealization disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with personality disorder
Experiences of depersonalization or derealization may occur in personality disorder, especially 
when the person is under stress. If the symptoms are better accounted for by personality disorder, 
an additional diagnosis of depersonalization-derealization disorder should not be assigned.
Other specified dissociative disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by symptoms that share primary clinical features with 
other dissociative disorders (i.e. involuntary disruption or discontinuity in the normal 
integration of one or more of the following: identity, sensations, perceptions, affects, 
thoughts, memories, control over bodily movements or behaviour).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements of any of the other disorders in the 
grouping of dissociative disorders.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. post-traumatic 
stress disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders).
•	 The symptoms are involuntary and unwanted, and are not accepted as a part of a collective 
cultural or religious practice.
•	 The symptoms are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous 
system – including withdrawal effects – (e.g. blackouts or chaotic behaviour during 
substance intoxication), and are not due to a disease of the nervous system (e.g. complex 
partial seizures), a sleep-wake disorder (e.g. symptoms occur during hypnagogic or 
hypnopompic states), head trauma or another medical condition.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.

Feeding and eating disorders involve abnormal eating or feeding behaviours that are not better 
accounted for by another medical condition, and are not developmentally appropriate or culturally 
sanctioned. Feeding disorders involve behavioural disturbances that are not related to body weight 
or shape concerns, such as eating of non-edible substances or voluntary regurgitation of foods. 
Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food, accompanied 
in most instances by prominent body weight or shape concerns.
Feeding and eating disorders include the following:
Feeding and eating disorder diagnoses should not be used to classify low-level concerns related to 
eating or behaviours that are common or culturally sanctioned.
Feeding and eating disorders

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

General cultural considerations for feeding and eating disorders
•	 Weight and shape concerns are prevalent in many societies, and dieting to lose weight 
is common. Cultural preoccupation with body weight and shape – for example, due to 
global dissemination of body ideals through mass media (typically low weight in women 
and muscular physique in men) – has contributed to increased rates of eating disorders 
in many parts of the world. The global obesity epidemic has also contributed to social 
concerns about eating and weight.
•	 The prevalence of feeding and eating disorders varies by region, including differences by 
gender. For example, weight concerns and eating disturbances are more prevalent among 
men in some Asian and eastern Mediterranean societies than in the Americas.
Anorexia nervosa
Essential (required) features
•	 Significantly low body weight for the individual’s height, age, developmental stage or weight 
history is required for diagnosis. A commonly used threshold is body mass index (BMI) 
of less than 18.5 kg/m2 in adults and BMI for age under the 5th percentile in children 
and adolescents. Rapid weight loss (e.g. more than 20% of total body weight within 6 
months) may replace the essential feature of low body weight, as long as other diagnostic 
requirements are met. Children and adolescents may exhibit failure to gain weight as 
expected based on the individual developmental trajectory rather than weight loss.
•	 Low body weight is not better accounted for by another medical condition or the 
unavailability of food.
•	 The presentation is characterized by a persistent pattern of restrictive eating or other 
behaviours aimed at establishing or maintaining abnormally low body weight, typically 
associated with extreme fear of weight gain. Behaviours may be aimed at reducing energy 
intake by fasting, choosing low-calorie food, excessively slow eating of small amounts 
of food, and hiding or spitting out food, as well as by purging behaviours such as self-
induced vomiting and use of laxatives, diuretics or enemas, or omission of insulin doses in 
individuals with diabetes. Behaviours may also be aimed at increasing energy expenditure 
through excessive exercise, motor hyperactivity, deliberate exposure to cold and use of 
medication that increases energy expenditure (e.g. stimulants, weight-loss medication, 
herbal products for reducing weight, thyroid hormones).
•	 Excessive preoccupation with body weight or shape is apparent. Low body weight is 
overvalued and central to the person’s self-evaluation, or the person’s body weight or shape 
is inaccurately perceived to be normal or even excessive. Preoccupation with weight or 
shape, when not explicitly reported, may be manifested in behaviours such as repeatedly 
checking body weight using scales; repeatedly checking body shape using tape measures 
or reflection in mirrors; constantly monitoring the calorie content of food or searching for

Feeding and eating disorders
information on how to lose weight; or exhibiting extreme avoidant behaviours, such as 
refusal to have mirrors at home, avoidance of tight-fitting clothes, or refusal to know one’s 
weight or to purchase clothing with specified sizing.
Specifiers for underweight status
In the context of anorexia nervosa, severe underweight status is an important prognostic factor 
that is associated with a high risk of physical complications and substantially increased mortality. 
In adults, very low BMI has been found to be associated with poorer long-term prognosis among 
individuals with anorexia nervosa, although it is not the sole determinant of medical risk.
Anorexia nervosa with significantly low body weight
•	 Anorexia nervosa with significantly low body weight meets all diagnostic requirements for 
anorexia nervosa, with BMI between 18.5 kg/m2 and 14.0 kg/m2 in adults or BMI for age 
between the 5th and 0.3rd percentile in children and adolescents.
Anorexia nervosa with dangerously low body weight
•	 Anorexia nervosa with dangerously low body weight meets all diagnostic requirements for 
anorexia nervosa, with BMI of under 14.0 kg/m2 in adults or BMI for age under the 0.3rd 
percentile (fewer than three in one thousand) in children and adolescents. In the context 
of anorexia nervosa, dangerously low body weight is an important prognostic factor that is 
associated with a high risk of physical complications and substantially increased mortality.
Anorexia nervosa in recovery with normal body weight
•	 Among individuals who are recovering from anorexia nervosa who have achieved a healthy 
body weight, the diagnosis should be retained until a full and lasting recovery is achieved. 
A full and lasting recovery includes maintenance of a healthy weight and the cessation 
of behaviours aimed at reducing body weight for a sustained period (e.g. at least 1 year) 
following the termination of treatment.

Specifiers for the pattern of weight-related behaviours
Different patterns of weight-related behaviours among individuals with anorexia nervosa may be 
related to treatment selection and clinical management, as well as the course and outcome of the 
disorder. The following specifiers may be applied to 6B80.0 Anorexia nervosa with significantly 
low body weight and 6B80.1 Anorexia nervosa with dangerously low body weight. (The x below 
corresponds to the fifth-character code 0 or 1, indicating the individual’s underweight status.)
6B80.x0 restricting pattern
The restricting pattern specifier should be assigned to individuals with anorexia 
nervosa who induce weight loss and maintain low body weight through restricted 
food intake or fasting, alone or in combination with increased energy expenditure 
(e.g. through excessive exercise), but who do not engage in binge-eating or purging 
behaviours.
6B80.x1 binge-purge pattern
The binge-purge pattern specifier should be assigned to individuals with anorexia 
nervosa who present with episodes of binge-eating or purging behaviours aimed at 
getting rid of ingested food (e.g. self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse or enemas). 
This type of anorexia nervosa also includes individuals who exhibit binge-eating 
episodes but do not purge.
6B80.xZ unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Signs of low body weight may include visible or measurable signs of starvation, such 
as emaciation (lack of fat and muscle mass), extremities that feel cold to the touch or 
appear blue, hair loss, growth of fine “lanugo” hair, oedema, proximal muscle weakness, 
amenorrhea, osteopenia or osteoporosis, slow heart rate and low blood pressure.
•	 An explicitly stated fear of weight gain is not an absolute requirement for the diagnosis of 
anorexia nervosa, as long as the behaviours maintaining underweight status appear to be 
intentional, and there are other behavioural indicators of preoccupation with body weight 
or shape (e.g. repeated checking or monitoring, or extreme avoidance behaviours).
•	 Individuals with anorexia nervosa often show a persistent lack of recognition that they 
are underweight or excessively thin, and dismiss objective evidence regarding their actual 
weight or shape and the seriousness of their condition.
•	 Medical risk among individuals with anorexia nervosa is not solely dependent on weight 
status. Medical assessment should take into account other important medical risk factors 
as part of a comprehensive physical examination. Other risk factors include, but are not 
limited to, rapid weight loss (especially in children), orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia 
or postural tachycardia, hypothermia, cardiac arrhythmia and biochemical disturbance.
Feeding and eating disorders | Anorexia nervosa

Feeding and eating disorders
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Anorexia nervosa must be associated with significantly low body weight for the individual’s 
height, age, developmental stage or weight history, and with extreme attitudes and 
behaviours that distinguish it from normal dieting and “normative discontent” with one’s 
body shape and weight.
Course features
•	 Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood (i.e. between 
the ages of 10 and 24 years), typically following a stressful life event. Early-onset anorexia 
nervosa (prior to puberty) and late-onset anorexia nervosa (after the age of 40 years) are 
relatively rare.
•	 Many individuals display a period of altered eating behaviours prior to meeting the full 
diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa.
•	 Although some individuals recover fully after a single episode of anorexia nervosa, many 
experience a chronic course of illness over many years.
•	 Individuals with severe symptoms of anorexia nervosa may require hospitalization to 
restore weight and address medical complications. These individuals are less likely to 
experience remission of symptoms.
•	 Most individuals diagnosed with anorexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years 
of onset. However, even after an individual no longer meets the diagnostic requirements 
for anorexia nervosa, they are more likely to have a lower body weight and increased 
psychological features associated with anorexia nervosa (e.g. perfectionism) compared to 
the general population.
•	 Anorexia nervosa is associated with premature death, often due to medical complications 
of starvation or to suicide.
Developmental presentations
•	 Children with anorexia nervosa may not be able to articulate body-image concerns and 
emotions related to restrictive eating. Presenting features among children may include 
avoidance of food intake with denial of the severity of malnutrition for reasons other than 
body-image concerns (e.g. reporting they are “not hungry” or have abdominal pain), as 
well as nonverbal forms of food refusal.
•	 Children with anorexia nervosa are less likely to engage in binge eating and purging, or to 
engage in other compensatory behaviours.
•	 The prognosis for adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa is better than the prognosis 
for adults with anorexia nervosa.
Feeding and eating disorders | Anorexia nervosa

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Older individuals with anorexia nervosa who have had a longer duration of illness often 
exhibit chronic medical complications.
Culture-related features
•	 Symptom presentation of anorexia nervosa varies across cultural groups. For example, 
in Asia, a subset of individuals with anorexia nervosa may not express fear of weight 
gain (sometimes referred to as “fat phobia”) as a rationale for reducing energy intake. 
Instead, dietary restriction may be attributed to gastrointestinal discomfort or to cultural 
or religious motives (fasting or dietary rules). Such cases should still be regarded as 
meeting the excessive preoccupation with body weight or shape essential feature if clinical 
observation or collateral history supports the conclusion that they are motivated by an 
intention to lose weight or to prevent weight gain.
•	 Anorexia nervosa occurs in all cultures, but cross-cultural variations exist in prevalence 
and presentation. For example, the incidence of anorexia nervosa is greater in high-income 
countries and in populations with higher levels of globalization and related transformations 
in sociocultural values, gender roles, work, food supply and lifestyle. The prevalence of 
anorexia nervosa is very low in Africa and Latin America, and among African Americans 
and Latin Americans in the United States compared to the prevalence found in Europe and 
some Asian countries, such as China and Japan.
•	 The prevalence of anorexia nervosa among men is increasing globally, and more men are 
presenting for treatment of the disorder.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Globally, anorexia nervosa is up to 10 times more commonly diagnosed among females. 
Lifetime prevalence among women has been reported to be between 0.8% and 6.3% in 
Western settings. Emerging studies from eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America show a 
similar range of prevalence.
•	 Less is known about the true prevalence of anorexia nervosa in males. However, there is 
evidence that incidence and detection of anorexia nervosa in males is increasing.
•	 The onset of anorexia nervosa is earlier in females.
•	 Laxative abuse is more common among females; excessive exercise is more common 
among males.
•	 Males with anorexia nervosa are more likely to be preoccupied with being insufficiently 
muscular or lean – in response, they may exhibit unusual eating behaviours (e.g. excessive 
protein consumption along with caloric restriction) or engage in excessive exercise for the 
purpose of attaining and maintaining low body weight or a low percentage of body fat. If 
low body weight and low body weight idealization are not part of the clinical presentation, 
a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered (see the section on 
boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis) below).
Feeding and eating disorders | Anorexia nervosa

Feeding and eating disorders
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with bulimia nervosa
Individuals with anorexia nervosa may engage in binge eating and purging, but can be 
distinguished from individuals with bulimia nervosa by their very low body weight. A significant 
proportion of individuals with anorexia nervosa continue to exhibit binging and/or purging 
symptoms after they have regained a more normal weight. In such cases, the diagnosis may be 
changed to bulimia nervosa after 1 year during which body weight has not been sufficiently low 
to meet the diagnostic requirements of anorexia nervosa.
Boundary with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder
Behaviours to establish or maintain an abnormally low body weight in anorexia nervosa are usually 
explicitly motivated by a desire for thinness or an intense fear of gaining weight. However, other 
rationales for disturbances in eating behaviours or weight loss in anorexia nervosa may be given, 
such as fear of physical discomfort (e.g. stomach bloating), self-punishment, or religious or moral 
reasons. In cases in which the individual otherwise meets the diagnostic requirements of anorexia 
nervosa but weight- or shape-related concerns are not explicitly endorsed, the altered eating 
behaviours should only be considered as diagnostic of anorexia nervosa if clinical observation or 
collateral history supports the conclusion that they are motivated by an intention to lose weight 
or to prevent weight gain. When such individuals begin to alter their eating behaviours and to 
gain weight, often as a result of treatment, it is common for more explicit weight- or shape-related 
concerns to emerge. In cases where concerns about body weight or shape continue to be absent in 
spite of alteration of eating behaviours and weight gain, it is generally more appropriate to change 
the diagnosis to avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder.
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Beliefs that may be considered unusual, are demonstrably untrue, or even appear to be delusional 
in intensity or fixity may be present in individuals with anorexia nervosa, but these are generally 
restricted to issues of food, weight and shape, and are otherwise consistent with the psychopathology 
of anorexia nervosa. Examples include a conviction that one is fat when one is demonstrably 
underweight, or a belief that one’s caloric intake is excessive when it is in fact insufficient to 
maintain a normal weight. Such beliefs are consistent with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, and 
an additional diagnosis of delusional disorder or other psychotic disorder is not warranted in 
such cases. However, if other delusional beliefs are present (e.g. persecutory delusions that are 
unrelated to weight, shape or food intake) or there are other psychotic symptoms (e.g. thought 
disorder, hallucinations), a separate diagnosis of a primary psychotic disorder may be warranted.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Individuals with anorexia nervosa often experience repetitive and persistent thoughts about their 
weight or shape or about food, which can resemble obsessions. They may also engage in repetitive 
behaviours in response to these thoughts (e.g. exercise, purging). If repetitive thoughts and 
behaviours are limited to concerns about weight or shape or about food, an additional diagnosis 
of obsessive-compulsive disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with body dysmorphic disorder
Body dysmorphic disorder is distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that preoccupations and 
body-image disturbance in body dysmorphic disorder are focused on features other than overall 
Feeding and eating disorders | Anorexia nervosa

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

weight, shape and size (e.g. preoccupation with the nose or skin), and are not accompanied by 
disturbance in eating behaviour or marked weight loss. Some individuals (primarily males) with 
body dysmorphic disorder exhibit muscle dysmorphia such that they are preoccupied about 
being insufficiently muscular or lean and, in response, may exhibit unusual eating behaviours 
(e.g. excessive protein consumption) or engage in excessive exercise (e.g. weightlifting). In these 
cases, behaviours related to diet and exercise are motivated by a desire to be more muscular rather 
than to attain or maintain a low body weight. However, if low body weight idealization is central 
to the clinical presentation, and body weight is sufficiently low, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa 
instead of body dysmorphic disorder should be assigned.
Bulimia nervosa
Essential (required) features
•	 Frequent, recurrent episodes of binge eating (e.g. once a week or more over a period of at 
least 1 month) are required for diagnosis. Binge eating is defined as a discrete period of time 
(e.g. 2 hours) during which the individual experiences a loss of control over their eating 
behaviour, and eats notably more or differently than usual. Loss of control over eating may 
be described by the individual as feeling like they cannot stop or limit the amount or type 
of food eaten; having difficulty stopping eating once they have started; or giving up even 
trying to control their eating because they know they will end up overeating.
•	 The presentation is characterized by repeated inappropriate compensatory behaviours to 
prevent weight gain (e.g. once a week or more over a period of at least 1 month). The most 
common compensatory behaviour is self-induced vomiting, which typically occurs within 
an hour of binge eating. Other inappropriate compensatory behaviours include fasting or 
using diuretics to induce weight loss, using laxatives or enemas to reduce the absorption 
of food, omission of insulin doses in individuals with diabetes, and strenuous exercise to 
greatly increase energy expenditure.
•	 Excessive preoccupation with body weight or shape is apparent. Preoccupation with weight 
or shape, when not explicitly reported, may be manifested in behaviours such as repeatedly 
checking body weight using scales; repeatedly checking body shape using tape measures 
or reflection in mirrors; constantly monitoring the calorie content of food or searching for 
information on how to lose weight; or exhibiting extreme avoidant behaviours, such as 
refusal to have mirrors at home, avoidance of tight-fitting clothes, or refusal to know one’s 
weight or to purchase clothing with specified sizing.
•	 There is marked distress about the pattern of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory 
behaviour, or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational 
or other important areas of functioning. During the early phases of the disorder, symptoms 
may be concealed and functioning maintained through significant additional effort.
•	 The symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa.
6B81
Feeding and eating disorders | Bulimia nervosa

Feeding and eating disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Binge-eating episodes may be “objective”, in which the individual eats an amount of food 
that is larger than what most people would eat under similar circumstances, or “subjective”, 
which may involve eating amounts of food that might be objectively considered to be within 
normal limits but are subjectively experienced as large by the individual. In either case, the 
core feature of a binge-eating episode is the experience of loss of control over eating.
•	 Additional characteristics of binge-eating episodes may include eating much more rapidly 
than usual, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not 
feeling physically hungry, or eating alone because of embarrassment.
•	 Binge eating is typically experienced as very distressing. This is often manifested in 
negative emotions such as guilt, disgust or shame, which also typically negatively affect the 
individual’s self-evaluation.
•	 Bulimia nervosa may be associated with weight gain over time. However, individuals with 
bulimia nervosa may be of normal weight or even low weight (although not sufficiently 
low to meet the diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa). The diagnosis of bulimia 
nervosa is based on the presence of regular binge eating and inappropriate compensatory 
behaviours, regardless of overweight status.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Infrequent overeating or feasting during culturally sanctioned holidays or occasional 
celebrations should not be characterized as binge eating for the purpose of assigning a 
diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Similarly, exercise qualifies as inappropriate compensatory 
behaviour only if it is unusually intensive or prolonged, or is carried out to the exclusion of 
other activities or in spite of fatigue, pain or injury.
Course features
•	 Like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa most commonly has its onset during the period 
from adolescence to early adulthood (i.e. between the ages of 10 and 24 years), typically 
following a stressful life event. Onset prior to puberty or after the age of 40 years is 
relatively rare.
•	 Bulimia nervosa is characterized by a variable course that can manifest as persistent 
symptoms or intermittent episodes of remission and exacerbation. Outcome appears to be 
related to course, such that individuals whose symptoms remit for a period longer than 1 
year tend not to experience relapse of the disorder.
Feeding and eating disorders |  Bulimia nervosa

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk of substance use, 
suicidality and health complications (e.g. gastrointestinal problems) that can lead to 
premature death.
•	 Some individuals may cease purging or compensatory behaviours but continue to engage 
in binge eating. In this case, the diagnosis may be changed to binge-eating disorder if all 
diagnostic requirements are met.
•	 Stressful life events or a history of anorexia nervosa increase the likelihood of the onset 
of bulimia nervosa. A restricting pattern in anorexia nervosa may evolve over time into 
a pattern of binging and purging in bulimia nervosa. In such cases, the diagnosis may be 
changed to bulimia nervosa after 1 year during which body weight has not been sufficiently 
low to meet the diagnostic requirements of anorexia nervosa.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of bulimia nervosa typically occurs during or shortly after puberty. Young children 
do not commonly engage in binge eating due to a lack of access and control of 
food availability.
Culture-related features
•	 The prevalence of bulimia nervosa is higher in cultures characterized by an idealized thin 
body ideal. In addition, the prevalence of bulimia nervosa is increasing in countries that 
are industrializing and transitioning to more global and urbanized societies.
•	 The distribution of bulimia nervosa across cultural groups within a society can change 
over time. For example, in the United States, the incidence of the disorder appears to be 
decreasing among Euro-American females and increasing among ethnic minority groups – 
particularly Latin Americans and African Americans.
•	 Purging methods may be locally specific, such as the use of herbal purgatives in Asia and 
the Pacific region (e.g. seaweed and herbal teas in Japan; indigenous tea in Fiji), and justified 
with medicinal or other rationales that may obscure their pathological significance.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Bulimia nervosa is more prevalent among females.
•	 Males are less likely than females to engage in purging behaviours, and have a greater 
tendency to use excessive exercise or steroids as compensatory behaviours in response to 
binges. Males are also less likely to seek treatment.
Feeding and eating disorders | Bulimia nervosa

Feeding and eating disorders
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with anorexia nervosa
Individuals with anorexia nervosa may engage in binge eating and purging, but can be 
distinguished from individuals with bulimia nervosa by their very low body weight. If binge 
eating and purging are associated with very low body weight (i.e. BMI of less than 18.5 kg/m2 in 
adults and BMI for age under the 5th percentile in children and adolescents), and all the other 
diagnostic requirements are met, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, binge-purge pattern, rather 
than bulimia nervosa should be assigned. Moreover, a significant proportion of individuals with 
anorexia nervosa continue to exhibit binging or purging behaviours after they have regained a 
more normal weight. In such cases, the diagnosis may be changed to bulimia nervosa after 1 year 
during which body weight has not been sufficiently low to meet the diagnostic requirements of 
anorexia nervosa.
Boundary with binge-eating disorder
Binge eating that is not associated with regular compensatory behaviours should be diagnosed as 
binge-eating disorder rather than bulimia nervosa.
Binge-eating disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Frequent, recurrent episodes of binge eating (e.g. once a week or more over a period of 
3 months) are required for diagnosis. Binge eating is defined as a discrete period of time 
(e.g. 2 hours) during which the individual experiences a loss of control over their eating 
behaviour and eats notably more or differently than usual. Loss of control over eating may 
be described by the individual as feeling like they cannot stop or limit the amount or type 
of food eaten; having difficulty stopping eating once they have started; or giving up even 
trying to control their eating because they know they will end up overeating.
•	 The binge-eating episodes are not regularly accompanied by inappropriate compensatory 
behaviours aimed at preventing weight gain.
•	 The symptoms and behaviours are not better accounted for by another medical condition 
(e.g. Prader-Willi syndrome) or mental disorder (e.g. a depressive disorder), and are not 
due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including 
withdrawal effects.
•	 There is marked distress about the pattern of binge eating, or significant impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. 
During the earlier phases of the disorder, symptoms may be concealed and functioning 
maintained through significant additional effort.
6B82
Feeding and eating disorders | Binge-eating disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Binge-eating episodes may be “objective”, in which the individual eats an amount of food 
that is larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances, or “subjective”, 
which may involve eating amounts of food that might be objectively considered to be within 
normal limits but are subjectively experienced as large by the individual. In either case, the 
core feature of a binge-eating episode is the experience of loss of control over eating.
•	 Additional characteristics of binge-eating episodes may include eating much more rapidly 
than usual, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not 
feeling physically hungry, or eating alone because of embarrassment.
•	 Binge eating is typically experienced as very distressing. This is often manifested in 
negative emotions such as guilt, disgust or shame, which also typically negatively affect the 
individual’s self-evaluation.
•	 When there are multiple binge-eating episodes per week and these are associated with 
significant distress, it may be appropriate to assign the diagnosis after a shorter period 
(e.g. 1 month).
•	 Binge-eating disorder is often associated with weight gain over time and obesity. However, 
individuals with binge-eating disorder may be of normal weight or even low weight 
(although not sufficiently to meet the diagnostic requirements for anorexia nervosa). 
The diagnosis of binge-eating disorder is based on the presence of regular binge eating 
that is not accompanied by regular inappropriate compensatory behaviours, regardless of 
overweight status.
•	 Preoccupation with one’s body weight or shape, frequent checking or avoidance of checking 
body weight or size, and strong influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation are 
commonly present, although not required for a diagnosis of binge-eating disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Infrequent overeating or feasting during culturally sanctioned holidays or occasional 
celebrations should not be characterized as binge eating for the purpose of assigning a 
diagnosis of binge-eating disorder.
•	 Individuals who report patterns of overeating that do not meet the definition of binge 
eating should not be diagnosed with binge-eating disorder. Examples include mindless 
eating that can be resisted or stopped (e.g. if there is a distraction or interruption), or 
eating more than originally intended without a sense of loss of control, even if this kind of 
eating is distressing.
Feeding and eating disorders | Binge-eating disorder

Feeding and eating disorders
Course features
•	 Onset of binge-eating disorder is typically during adolescence or young adulthood, but can 
also begin in later adulthood.
•	 The experience of loss of control over eating or sporadic episodes of binge eating may 
occur prior to the onset of binge-eating disorder.
•	 Binge-eating disorder is more common among individuals seeking weight-loss treatment. 
Typically, these individuals seek weight-loss treatment after the onset of the disorder; binge 
eating does not typically arise as a consequence of treatment.
•	 Binge-eating disorder occurs more often among overweight and obese individuals than 
those with normal BMI.
•	 Individuals who seek treatment for binge-eating disorder are typically older in age 
compared to individuals who seek treatment for other feeding and eating disorders.
•	 Binge-eating disorder, although often persistent, has a higher rate of remission than other 
feeding and eating disorders, with remission sometimes occurring spontaneously.
•	 The features of binge-eating disorder may evolve over time, such that another feeding or 
eating disorder may better characterize the current symptoms.
Developmental presentations
•	 In children, as in adults, binge-eating disorder is associated with weight gain, increased 
body fat, concealing one’s eating and use of binge eating to regulate emotions.
•	 Binge-eating disorder is more difficult to diagnose in childhood due to normative difficulty 
engaging in introspection in order to articulate reasons for binge-eating behaviour. 
Children are likely to report feeling out of control while eating rather than indicating that 
the amount of food consumed was excessive.
•	 Children with binge-eating disorder may experience less frequent and briefer binges than 
adults because they typically cannot gain access to food without the assistance of adults.
•	 Binge-eating disorder is common among adolescents and young adults.
Culture-related features
•	 Compared to other feeding and eating disorders, binge-eating disorder appears to be 
more equally distributed across countries, ethnic groups and genders. The prevalence of 
binge-eating disorder is at least as high in low- and middle-income countries as across 
high-income countries, and tends to correlate with rise of BMI in the general population.
Feeding and eating disorders | Binge-eating disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The relationship between ideal body size, body satisfaction and binge-eating disorder is 
complex. For example, women who report strong identification with African American or 
Black Caribbean culture also tend to report larger body ideals and higher body satisfaction, 
yet tend to have elevated rates of binge eating.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Binge-eating disorder is more prevalent among females.
•	 There are no significant gender-related differences in the symptoms or course of binge-
eating disorder.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with bulimia nervosa
If an individual regularly engages in inappropriate compensatory behaviours following episodes 
of binge eating (e.g. self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives, enemas, diuretics, fasting, strenuous 
exercise or omitting insulin), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa rather than binge-eating disorder 
should be assigned.
Boundary with obesity
Obesity is a common consequence of binge-eating disorder and should be recorded separately. 
However, obese individuals who report overeating patterns that do not meet the definition of 
binge eating should not be diagnosed with binge-eating disorder.
Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Avoidance or restriction of food intake is required for diagnosis, which results in either or 
both of the following:
•	 the intake of an insufficient quantity or variety of food to meet adequate energy or 
nutritional requirements that has resulted in significant weight loss, clinically significant 
nutritional deficiencies, dependence on oral nutritional supplements or tube feeding, or 
has otherwise negatively affected the physical health of the individual;
•	 significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning (e.g. due to avoidance or distress related to participating 
in social experiences involving eating).
6B83
Feeding and eating disorders | Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder

Feeding and eating disorders
•	 The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight or 
shape.
•	 Restricted food intake and consequent weight loss (or failure to gain weight), or other 
impacts on physical health or related functional impairment, are not due to unavailability 
of food; are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. food allergies, 
hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder; and are not due to the effects of a substance or 
medication, including withdrawal effects.
Additional clinical features
•	 A variety of reasons may be given for restriction of food intake, such as lack of interest in 
eating, avoidance of foods with certain sensory characteristics (e.g. smell, taste, appearance, 
texture, colour, temperature) or concern about perceived aversive consequences of eating 
(e.g. choking, vomiting, health problems), which in some cases is related to a history of 
aversive food-related experience such as choking or vomiting after eating a particular type 
of food. In many cases, however, there is no identifiable event that preceded the onset of 
the disorder.
•	 Some individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder present with a longstanding 
lack of interest in food or eating, chronically low appetite or poor ability to recognize 
hunger. In other cases, restriction of food intake may be more variable and significantly 
affected by emotional or psychological factors. This latter pattern may be associated with 
high levels of distractibility or with high levels of emotional arousal and extreme resistance 
in situations in which eating is expected. Individuals with this pattern, especially children, 
often require significant prompting and encouragement to eat.
•	 Individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder generally do not experience any 
difficulties eating foods within their preferred range, and may therefore not be underweight.
•	 Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder can negatively affect family functioning, such 
that mealtimes may be associated with increased distress (e.g. infants may be more irritable 
during feeding, children may try to negotiate what food is present or how much they need 
to consume at mealtimes).
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 People with unusual patterns of eating behaviour or who are exceptionally “picky eaters” 
should not be diagnosed with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder in the absence of 
significant weight loss or other health consequences (e.g. clinically significant nutritional 
deficiencies, increases in blood lipids due to selective eating of fatty foods) or impairment 
in psychosocial functioning (e.g. limited participation in social activities where preferred 
foods are not available). Distress on the part of parents or other caregivers related to 
selective eating in the absence of identifiable health consequences or impairment in the 
individual’s functioning is not a basis for assigning the diagnosis.
Feeding and eating disorders |  Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Avoidance of specific foods or limitation of food intake due to religious or other culturally 
sanctioned practices does not meet the diagnostic requirements of avoidant-restrictive 
food intake disorder unless the pattern of restricted food intake has negatively affected the 
physical health of the individual or resulted in significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Course features
•	 Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may be associated with delays in typical 
development (e.g. growth, learning), particularly if significant malnutrition is present.
•	 Among individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, avoidant and restrictive 
patterns of eating may persist into adulthood.
•	 Individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may develop certain features of 
anorexia nervosa over time (e.g. concerns about body weight or negative attitudes about 
fatness), but do not typically develop the body image distortion commonly seen in anorexia 
nervosa. Otherwise, evidence that avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is associated 
with later diagnoses of other feeding and eating disorders is limited.
Developmental presentations
•	 Avoidant eating or feeding often starts in early childhood, but initial presentations in older 
children, adolescents and adults also occur.
Culture-related features
•	 Individuals who avoid specific foods because of widely accepted food choice practices, such 
as vegetarianism or veganism, or due to religious observances (e.g. fasting, purification or 
ritual proscription of foods), should not be diagnosed with the disorder unless the restricted 
eating behaviour exceeds the usual norms of the individual’s cultural or religious group, 
and is associated with health or functional consequences that warrant clinical attention.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The prevalence of avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is similar among males and 
females. When avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder co-occurs with autism spectrum 
disorder, prevalence is higher among males.
Feeding and eating disorders | Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder

Feeding and eating disorders
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with anorexia nervosa
Individuals with anorexia nervosa, like individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, 
present with a pattern of restricted eating and significantly low body weight, with similar 
health-related consequences. The difference is that in anorexia nervosa, behaviours to establish 
or maintain an abnormally low body weight are usually explicitly motivated by a desire for 
thinness or an intense fear of gaining weight. However, other rationales for disturbances in eating 
behaviours or weight loss in anorexia nervosa may be given, such as fear of physical discomfort 
(e.g. stomach bloating), self-punishment, or religious or moral reasons. In cases in which the 
individual otherwise meets the diagnostic requirements of anorexia nervosa but weight- or 
shape-related concerns are not explicitly endorsed, the altered eating behaviours should only be 
considered diagnostic of anorexia nervosa if clinical observation or collateral history supports the 
conclusion that they are motivated by an intention to lose weight or to prevent weight gain. Some 
individuals initially diagnosed with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may exhibit more 
explicit weight- or shape-related concerns over the course of treatment as they begin to alter their 
eating behaviours and to gain weight. In such cases, it may be appropriate to change the diagnosis 
to anorexia nervosa if all diagnostic requirements are met.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
In some individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, the pattern of food avoidance 
stems from sensory sensitivities related to the smell, taste, temperature, texture or appearance 
of foods. For example, an individual may eat only foods of a particular colour, or will refuse 
solids or accept only a very narrow range of foods based on packaging or a particular brand. 
Some individuals with autism spectrum disorder may also restrict intake of certain foods because 
of their sensory characteristics (e.g. hypersensitivity to food texture) or because of inflexible 
adherence to particular routines (e.g. eating the same foods at the same time in the same order or 
only eating specific brands of food with specific packaging). However, autism spectrum disorder 
is also characterized by persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication 
and reciprocal social interactions, and persistent restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of 
behaviour, interests or activities that are unrelated to food. If a pattern of restricted eating in 
an individual with autism spectrum disorder has caused significant weight loss or other health 
consequences or is specifically associated with significant functional impairment, an additional 
diagnosis of avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with specific phobia and other anxiety and fear-related disorders
In some individuals with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, food avoidance may be related 
to perceived aversive consequences of eating (e.g. fear that swallowing particular foods may cause 
one to gag, choke or vomit, or concern about the development of health problems such as heart 
disease or cancer related to food intake). Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is commonly 
associated with anxiety symptoms in situations related to eating or food, which may become 
worse over time as the disorder evolves. If the pattern and intensity of anxiety symptoms in an 
individual with avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder meet all diagnostic requirements of 
specific phobia or another anxiety or fear-related disorder, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Feeding and eating disorders | Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with other mental disorders
Individuals experiencing a depressive episode may present with a lack of appetite or reduced 
interest in eating, and weight loss associated with depressed mood and other cognitive-behavioural 
or neurovegetative symptoms of a depressive episode. Similarly, individuals experiencing manic, 
mixed or hypomanic episodes may exhibit reduced interest in eating together with other features 
of a bipolar disorder. Avoidance or restriction of food intake with effects on weight and nutrition 
can also be present in schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders due to loss of appetite 
or due to paranoid ideas (e.g. fear of being poisoned). Motivations for restricted eating should 
be investigated carefully as a part of a complete mental health assessment in order to distinguish 
among these conditions. An additional diagnosis of avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder 
is generally not warranted if the restriction of food intake is fully accounted for by another 
mental disorder.
Boundary with other medical conditions
Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder should not be diagnosed if the eating disturbance is 
entirely accounted for by a gastrointestinal disorder or another medical condition that leads to 
reduced hunger, restricted eating or weight loss (e.g. food allergies, infectious diseases, cancer, 
hyperthyroidism).
Pica
Essential (required) features
•	 Regular consumption of non-nutritive substances, such as non-food objects and materials 
(e.g. clay, soil, chalk, plaster, plastic, metal and paper), or raw food ingredients (e.g. large 
quantities of salt or corn flour) is required for diagnosis.
•	 The ingestion of non-nutritive substances is persistent or severe enough to require clinical 
attention. That is, the behaviour causes damage or significant risk to health or impairment 
in functioning due to the frequency, amount or nature of the substances or objects ingested.
•	 Based on age and level of intellectual functioning, the individual would be expected to 
distinguish between edible and non-edible substances. In typical development, this occurs 
at approximately 2 years of age.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. 
nutritional deficiency).
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 It is normal for infants and very young children to put non-food objects in their mouths 
as a means of sensory exploration. The diagnosis of pica should not be applied to 
this phenomenon.
6B84
Feeding and eating disorders | Pica

Feeding and eating disorders
•	 Many pregnant women crave or eat non-nutritive substances (e.g. chalk or ice). In addition, 
the eating of non-nutritive substances is a culturally sanctioned practice among certain 
groups. A diagnosis of pica should only be assigned to such behaviour if it is persistent or 
potentially dangerous enough to require specific clinical attention.
Course features
•	 Pica can be episodic and variable, or chronic and continuous. When variable, consumption 
of non-nutritive substances may be associated with increased levels of stress or anxiety.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of pica can occur across the lifespan, but is most commonly observed in childhood.
Culture-related features
•	 In some cases, eating of non-nutritive substances may be a culturally sanctioned practice. 
In these cases, consumption of the non-nutritive substance is thought to have some health, 
spiritual or social benefit. In parts of Africa and certain rural areas of the United States 
and India, for example, the eating of clay or earth (geophagia) can be a culturally accepted 
practice. Pica should not be diagnosed in such cases unless the quantities ingested are large 
enough to require clinical attention.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The prevalence of pica is similar among males and females.
•	 Although females can be diagnosed with pica during pregnancy and the postpartum 
period, a diagnosis should only be assigned if consumption of non-nutritive substances is 
persistent or potentially dangerous enough to require specific clinical attention.
Feeding and eating disorders | Pica

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with nutritional deficiencies
Individuals who ingest non-nutritive substances as a symptom of specific nutritional deficiencies 
should not be diagnosed with pica unless the behaviour persists after the deficiency is corrected. 
For example, anaemia caused by vitamin B12, folate or iron deficiency can be associated with a 
craving to eat dirt.
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
The ingestion of non-nutritive substances is common in children or adults with disorders 
of intellectual development. An additional diagnosis of pica may be given, as long as that the 
individual is able to distinguish between edible and non-edible substances, if the behaviour is 
persistent or potentially dangerous enough to require specific clinical attention.
Boundary with factitious disorder and malingering
Individuals with factitious disorder or who are malingering may swallow harmful substances 
or objects in order to present themselves as ill. For example, prisoners may swallow harmful 
substances or objects in order to be transferred to hospital or to a setting that is less harsh or less 
restrictive. Pica should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
Individuals with anorexia nervosa may eat non-nutritive substances (e.g. tissues, paper) in order 
to suppress hunger. In trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) or excoriation (skin-picking) 
disorder, individuals sometimes eat hair or skin that they pull or pick from the body. Eating of 
non-nutritive substances may also occur in other mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental 
disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In all such cases, an additional 
diagnosis of pica should be assigned only if the behaviour is persistent or severe enough to require 
clinical attention. That is, the behaviour causes damage to health, impairment in functioning or 
significant risk due to the frequency, amount or nature of the substances or objects ingested.
Rumination-regurgitation disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The intentional and repeated bringing up of previously swallowed food back to the mouth 
(regurgitation), which may be re-chewed and re-swallowed (rumination), or may be 
deliberately spat out (but not as in vomiting), is required for diagnosis.
•	 The regurgitation behaviour is frequent (at least several times per week) and sustained over 
a period of at least several weeks.
•	 The diagnosis should only be assigned to individuals who have reached a developmental 
age of at least 2 years.
6B85
Feeding and eating disorders | Rumination-regurgitation disorder

Feeding and eating disorders
•	 The regurgitation behaviour is not a manifestation of another medical condition that 
directly causes regurgitation (e.g. oesophageal strictures or neuromuscular disorders 
affecting oesophageal functioning) or causes nausea or vomiting (e.g. pyloric stenosis).
Additional clinical features
•	 In rumination-regurgitation disorder, the regurgitation behaviour is intentional; for 
example, individuals may contract the tongue or abdominal muscles or cough in order 
to induce regurgitation. Individuals with rumination-regurgitation disorder are able to 
regurgitate food with relative ease, and may derive some reduction of anxiety or pleasure 
from the behaviour.
•	 Individuals with rumination-regurgitation disorder often experience shame and 
embarrassment about the behaviour, and try to keep the behaviour a secret because they 
recognize it as socially unacceptable.
•	 Individuals with rumination-regurgitation disorder are often reluctant to seek treatment. 
The disorder may persist for a very long duration if left untreated.
Course features
•	 Rumination-regurgitation disorder is slightly more prevalent among individuals with 
disorders of intellectual development and autism spectrum disorder, whereby it may serve 
a self-soothing or self-stimulating function.
•	 Rumination-regurgitation disorder may be chronic or continuous, or it may be episodic. 
In episodic cases, the behaviour may be associated with stress or anxiety.
•	 Adolescents and adults may be less likely to re-chew the regurgitated food, and older adults 
may choose to swallow or spit out the material depending on the social situation.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of rumination-regurgitation disorder may occur across early and later childhood, 
adolescence and adulthood.
•	 Rumination-regurgitation disorder can create a substantial risk of choking in very young 
children due to their inability to control their swallowing.
Feeding and eating disorders | Rumination-regurgitation disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Induced vomiting may be part of some yogic practices, and should not be considered a 
sign of the disorder unless the vomiting exceeds cultural norms and is associated with 
distress or impairment.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with infant rumination syndrome
Rumination-regurgitation disorder should not be diagnosed in infants. Similar phenomena in 
infants should be diagnosed as infant rumination syndrome in the grouping of functional digestive 
disorders of infants, toddlers or children in Chapter 13 on diseases of the digestive system.
Boundary with self-induced vomiting
Rumination-regurgitation disorder should be distinguished from self-induced vomiting. 
Self-induced vomiting may occur as a part of the presentation of anorexia nervosa, binge-purge 
pattern, or bulimia nervosa. Self-induced vomiting may also occur as a culturally sanctioned 
practice (e.g. among practitioners of yoga) that is not associated with a mental disorder.
Boundary with psychogenic vomiting
The differentiation from what has been considered to be “psychogenic vomiting”, or vomiting 
as a somatoform expression of distress – particularly in South Asia – is based on the fact that 
regurgitation in rumination-regurgitation disorder is typically volitional and intentional. If there 
is evidence that “psychogenic vomiting” is voluntary, a diagnosis of rumination-regurgitation 
disorder may be appropriate.
Other specified feeding and eating disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by abnormal eating or feeding behaviours.
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
feeding and eating disorders grouping.
6B8Y
Feeding and eating disorders | Other specified feeding and eating disorder

Feeding and eating disorders
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. a primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder or an 
obsessive-compulsive or related disorder).
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition that 
affects feeding or eating, are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, 
including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours result in significant risk or damage to health, significant 
distress, or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or 
other important areas of functioning.

Elimination disorders
Enuresis
Elimination disorders include the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (enuresis) and 
the repeated passage of faeces in inappropriate places (encopresis). These conditions occur in 
individuals at a developmental age when urinary and faecal continence is ordinarily expected to 
have been achieved, and may be voluntary or involuntary.
Elimination disorders include the following:
Enuresis
Essential (required) features
•	 Repeated and persistent voiding of urine into bed or clothes (e.g. several times per week 
over several months), which may occur during the day or at night, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual has reached a developmental age when urinary continence is ordinarily 
expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 5 years).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by the physiological effects of a substance 
or medication, or by another medical condition that causes polyuria or urgency (e.g. a 
urinary tract infection, untreated diabetes mellitus, a neurogenic bladder, a disease of the 
nervous system, a disease of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue, congenital or 
acquired abnormalities of the urinary tract).
Note: The symptom category MF50.2 Urinary incontinence or one of its subcategories from 
Chapter 21 on symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified, may be considered 
when the presentation does not meet the diagnostic requirements for enuresis. The diagnosis for 
any underlying medical condition believed to be causing the urinary incontinence should also 
be assigned.

Specifiers for nocturnal or diurnal occurrence
Nocturnal enuresis
•	 Inappropriate voiding of urine occurs only during the night. This is the most common 
form of enuresis, and typically occurs during the first part of the night soon after the 
individual has gone to sleep.
Diurnal enuresis
•	 Inappropriate voiding of urine occurs only during waking hours. This form of enuresis is 
also referred to as “urinary incontinence”.
Nocturnal and diurnal enuresis
•	 Inappropriate voiding of urine occurs both during the night and during waking hours.

•	 Voiding of urine is typically involuntary but, in some cases, may appear to be voluntary. 
The diagnosis can be assigned in either case.
•	 Voiding of urine during sleep may take place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, 
leading some individuals to report having dreamt of urinating.
•	 Diurnal enuresis may occur in children who avoid urination due to social anxiety about 
using a public bathroom or due to refusal to cease an activity that is enjoyable (e.g. playing 
a game).
•	 Enuresis may lead to the development of psychological problems due to associated distress 
or stigma. Enuresis may be an aspect of another mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental 
disorder, or both enuresis and another emotional/behavioural disturbance may arise in 
parallel due to related etiological factors. A diagnosis of enuresis may be assigned together 
with other mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses if the enuresis 
is a distinct focus of clinical attention.

Elimination disorders | Enuresis

Elimination disorders
•	 Enuresis is common among individuals with disorders of intellectual development. 
The diagnosis should only be assigned if all diagnostic requirements of enuresis are met, 
and the individual’s developmental age is equivalent to that at which urinary continence in 
normally expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 5 years).
•	 Enuresis can occur among individuals with neurocognitive disorders (e.g. dementia). 
The additional diagnosis of enuresis can be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met, 
and the condition requires separate clinical attention.
•	 Enuresis is more common among children with a parent who has a history of enuresis.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 It is not uncommon for children to experience occasional urinary incontinence up until 
middle childhood.
Course features
•	 Most children establish urinary control by adolescence, with a small number of individuals 
continuing to experience enuresis into adulthood.
•	 Enuresis that persists into adolescence is often associated with an increase in frequency of 
urinary voiding episodes.
Developmental presentations
•	 Enuresis may have been present from birth (i.e. an atypical extension of normal infantile 
incontinence), or may have its onset following a period of acquired bladder control.
•	 The common age of onset for children who have previously acquired urinary continence 
yet develop enuresis is between 5 and 8 years.
•	 Diurnal enuresis is less prevalent among children over the age of 9 years.
Culture-related features
•	 Cultural variation exists with regard to toilet training. Expectations regarding the age 
when continence occurs and whether enuresis is viewed as pathological vary by cultural 
group. Cultural norms may affect tolerance for the behaviours, expectations regarding 
their course, and the associated level of shame and stigma.

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Nocturnal enuresis is more prevalent among males, whereas diurnal enuresis is more 
prevalent among females.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with the effects of substances including medications
Enuresis may occur due to certain antipsychotic medications, diuretics or other substances or 
medications that stimulate incontinence. In these cases, incontinence should be considered a 
side-effect, and a diagnosis of enuresis is typically not warranted. If the enuresis was present 
before administration of medication, it may be appropriate to assign a diagnosis.
Boundary with other medical conditions
Enuresis should not be diagnosed if the symptoms are better accounted for by another medical 
condition that causes polyuria or urgency. A diagnosis of enuresis may be warranted if the 
urinary incontinence was present before the other medical condition developed, or persists after 
the individual has received treatment.
Encopresis
Essential (required) features
•	 Repeated and persistent passage of faeces in inappropriate places (e.g. at least once per 
month over a period of several months) is required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual has reached the developmental age when faecal continence is ordinarily 
expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 4 years).
•	 Faecal soiling is not better accounted for by the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. 
excessive use of laxatives) or another medical condition (e.g. aganglionic megacolon, spina 
bifida, anal stenosis, chronic diarrhoea, congenital or acquired abnormalities of the bowel 
or gastrointestinal infection).
Note: The symptom category ME07 Faecal incontinence or one of its subcategories from Chapter 
21 on symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified, may be considered when 
the presentation does not meet the diagnostic requirements for encopresis. The diagnosis for 
any underlying medical condition believed to be causing the faecal incontinence should also 
be assigned.

Specifiers for the presence of constipation and overflow
Encopresis with constipation and overflow incontinence
•	 Encopresis with constipation and overflow incontinence is the most common form of 
faecal soiling, and is characterized by retention and impaction of faeces. Stools are typically 
– but not always – poorly formed (loose or liquid), and leakage may range from occasional 
to continuous.
•	 There is often a history of toilet avoidance leading to constipation.
Encopresis without constipation and overflow incontinence
•	 Encopresis without constipation and overflow incontinence is not associated with retention 
and impaction of faeces but rather is characterized by reluctance, resistance or failure 
to conform to social norms in defecating in acceptable places in the context of normal 
physiological control over defecation.
•	 Stools are typically of normal consistency, and inappropriate defecation is likely to 
be intermittent.
Encopresis, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Encopresis is most often involuntary but, in some cases, may appear to be voluntary. 
The diagnosis can be assigned in either case. Involuntary passage of faeces is most often 
associated with encopresis with constipation and overflow incontinence.
•	 Encopresis that is intentional may be associated with oppositional defiant disorder or 
conduct-dissocial disorder.
•	 Stool withholding, or retentive behaviours, may be the result of avoidance of bowel 
movements, especially in those individuals with a history of difficulty or pain in passing 
stools. Individuals with chronic constipation and stool retention may go on to develop 
acquired megacolon.
•	 Specific phobias or social anxiety disorder (e.g. fear of using public bathrooms) may also 
contribute to retentive behaviours.
•	 Encopresis is common among individuals with disorders of intellectual development. 
The diagnosis should only be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are met, and the 
individual’s developmental age is equivalent to that at which faecal continence in normally 
expected (approximately equivalent to a chronological age of 4 years).

•	 Encopresis can occur among individuals with neurocognitive disorders (e.g. dementia). 
The additional diagnosis of encopresis can be assigned if all diagnostic requirements are 
met, and the condition requires separate clinical attention.
•	 Individuals diagnosed with encopresis may experience embarrassment and reduced self-
esteem. Older children diagnosed with encopresis may experience impairments in social 
functioning due to peer teasing and possible social isolation. Furthermore, individuals 
with encopresis may avoid social situations for fear of passing faeces in the presence of 
other people.
•	 Individuals with encopresis and chronic constipation may also experience co-occurring 
symptoms of enuresis. Both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements 
for each are met.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 It is not uncommon for children to experience an occasional soiling accident during 
early childhood. Faecal incontinence must occur frequently and persistently to warrant 
a diagnosis.
Course features
•	 Encopresis can persist for years, with recurrent episodes of worsening symptoms.
Developmental presentations
•	 Faecal incontinence may have been present from birth (i.e. an atypical extension of normal 
infantile incontinence), or may have its onset following a period of acquired bowel control.
•	 Encopresis has a high prevalence (between 1.5% and 7.5%) among school-aged children 
between the ages of 6 and 12 years.
 Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Encopresis is more prevalent among males.
•	 Females may be more likely to experience urinary tract infections co-occurring with 
encopresis due to contamination of the urethra with faecal bacteria.

Boundary with the effects of substances including medications
Faecal incontinence may occur due to certain medications including some antibiotics, some 
cancer medications, laxatives and antacids that contain magnesium. In these cases, a diagnosis 
of encopresis is typically not warranted. If the encopresis was present before administration of 
medication, it may be appropriate to assign a diagnosis.
Boundary with other medical conditions
Encopresis should not be diagnosed if the symptoms are better accounted for by another medical 
condition that causes faecal incontinence. A diagnosis of encopresis may be warranted if the 
faecal incontinence was present before the other medical condition developed, or persists after 
the individual has received adequate treatment.

Disorder of bodily distress or bodily experience, 
unspecified.
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience are characterized by disturbances in the person’s 
experience of their body. Bodily distress disorder involves bodily symptoms that the individual 
finds distressing, and to which excessive attention is directed. Body integrity dysphoria involves 
a disturbance in the person’s experience of the body manifested in the persistent desire to 
have a specific physical disability, accompanied by persistent discomfort or intense feelings of 
inappropriateness concerning current non-disabled body configuration.
Bodily distress disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of bodily symptoms that are distressing to the individual is required for 
diagnosis. Typically, this involves multiple bodily symptoms that may vary over time. 
Occasionally, the focus is limited to a single symptom – usually pain or fatigue.
6C20
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Bodily distress disorder
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience include the following:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Excessive attention is directed towards the symptoms, which may manifest in:
•	 persistent preoccupation with the severity of the symptoms or their negative 
consequences – in individuals who have an established medical condition that may be 
causing or contributing to the symptoms, a degree of attention related to the symptoms 
that is clearly excessive in relation to the nature and severity of the medical condition;
•	 repeated contacts with health-care providers related to the bodily symptoms that are 
substantially in excess of what would be considered medically necessary.
•	 Excessive attention to the bodily symptoms persists, despite appropriate clinical 
examination and investigations or appropriate reassurance from health-care providers.
•	 Bodily symptoms are persistent; that is, some symptoms are present (although not 
necessarily the same symptoms) on most days during a period of at least several months 
(e.g. 3 months or more).
•	 The bodily symptoms and related distress and preoccupation result in significant 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas 
of functioning.
•	 The symptoms or the associated distress and preoccupation are not better accounted for 
by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a 
mood disorder, or an anxiety or fear-related disorder).
Severity of bodily distress disorder
The severity of bodily distress disorder should be classified based on the degree of distress 
or preoccupation with bodily symptoms, the persistence of the disorder and the degree of 
impairment. The clinician should make a global determination of the appropriate rating 
of severity based on the overall clinical presentation, and select one of the following 
subcategories.
Mild bodily distress disorder
•	 All the essential features of bodily distress disorder are present.
•	 Although there is excessive attention to distressing symptoms and their consequences, 
which may result in frequent medical visits, the individual spends only a limited amount 
of time focusing on them (e.g. no more than 1 or 2 hours per day), and is able to focus on 
other unrelated topics.
•	 The bodily symptoms and related distress and preoccupation result in mild impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning 
(e.g. strain in relationships, less effective academic or occupational functioning, 
abandonment of specific leisure activities).
Moderate bodily distress disorder
•	 All the essential features of bodily distress disorder are present.
•	 Persistent preoccupation with the distressing symptoms and their consequences is typically 
6C20.0
6C20.1
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Bodily distress disorder

Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience
associated with frequent medical visits. The individual devotes a substantial amount of 
time and energy to focusing on the symptoms and their consequences (e.g. several hours 
per day).
•	 The bodily symptoms and related distress and preoccupation result in moderate 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas 
of functioning (e.g. relationship conflict, performance problems at work, abandonment of 
a range of social and leisure activities).
Severe bodily distress disorder
•	 All the essential features of bodily distress disorder are present.
•	 The presentation is characterized by a pervasive and persistent preoccupation with the 
distressing symptoms and their consequences, and a narrowing of interests such that 
the bodily symptoms and their consequences become the nearly exclusive focus of the 
individual’s life, typically resulting in extensive interactions with the health-care system.
•	 The bodily symptoms and related distress and preoccupation result in severe impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning 
(e.g. unable to work, alienation of friends and family, abandonment of nearly all social and 
leisure activities).
Bodily distress disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 The most common bodily symptoms associated with bodily distress disorder include 
pain (e.g. musculoskeletal pain, backache, headaches), fatigue, and gastrointestinal and 
respiratory symptoms, although patients may be preoccupied with any bodily symptoms. 
The individual can generally provide a detailed description of the symptoms, but it may be 
difficult for clinicians to account for the symptoms in anatomical or physiological terms.
•	 Individuals with bodily distress disorder often over-interpret or catastrophize about their 
bodily symptoms, and dwell on their most extreme negative consequences. For example, 
in more severe cases, pain or fatigue may be perceived as being so intense that they prevent 
normal activities, despite there being no medical basis for such a belief. This is often 
accompanied by fear of triggering pain or an exacerbation of other symptoms, which may 
lead to undue avoidance of activities; this may in turn lead to other symptoms associated 
with inactivity (e.g. stiffness and muscle weakness, muscle pain following minimal 
exertion).
•	 Individuals with bodily distress disorder may hold a range of attributions regarding their 
symptoms, including psychological and physical explanations. As severity increases, 
affected individuals are more likely to reject psychological explanations for their symptoms. 
Some individuals with bodily distress disorder believe that their bodily symptoms indicate 
underlying physical illness or injury (i.e. disease conviction), even though this has not 
been detected. Insistence that the symptoms are caused by an undiagnosed illness or 
6C20.2
6C20.Z
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Bodily distress disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

injury may result in multiple medical tests and procedures. This pattern is most common 
in individuals with severe bodily distress disorder, who may have long and complicated 
histories of contact with both primary and specialist medical services, during which many 
negative investigations or fruitless operations across various body systems may have been 
carried out.
•	 Individuals with bodily distress disorder most often present in general medical settings 
rather than for mental health services. They may be reluctant to agree that there is a 
psychological component to their experience, and may react negatively to the suggestion 
of a referral to a mental health professional.
•	 Individuals with bodily distress disorder often express dissatisfaction with the medical 
care they have received previously, and may change health-care providers frequently.
•	 In communities with limited access to health care, individuals with bodily distress disorder 
may not have extensive interactions with the formal health-care system, but they may seek 
care from alternative sources.
•	 Bodily distress disorder often occurs in the context of comorbid medical conditions and 
co-occurring mental disorders – especially depressive disorders and anxiety and fear-
related disorders.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The experience of bodily symptoms and occasional concern about them is normal. However, 
people with bodily distress disorder report greater distress about their bodily symptoms 
than would generally be regarded as proportional to the nature of the symptoms, and their 
excessive attention to their symptoms is not alleviated by appropriate clinical examination 
and investigations, and by reassurance from health-care providers.
•	 Individuals with bodily distress disorder who have a comorbid medical condition that 
may be causing or contributing to the bodily symptoms exhibit greater preoccupation with 
symptoms and greater functional impairment than those who have a medical condition that 
is similar in nature and severity without concurrent bodily distress disorder. Furthermore, 
the number of bodily symptoms reported often exceeds that usually associated with the 
comorbid medical condition.
Course features
•	 In about half of individuals diagnosed with bodily distress disorder seen in primary care 
settings, bodily symptoms resolve within 6–12 months. Individuals with severe disorder 
and those with multiple bodily symptoms tend to experience a more chronic and persistent 
course. The presence of multiple bodily symptoms is commonly associated with greater 
impairment in functioning, as well as with poorer treatment response for any co-occurring 
mental or medical conditions.
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Bodily distress disorder

Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience
Developmental presentations
•	 Bodily distress disorder can occur across the lifespan. The most common bodily symptoms 
in children and adolescents include recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal 
pain, nausea), fatigue, headaches and musculoskeletal pain. Children are more likely to 
experience a single recurrent symptom rather than multiple bodily symptoms. School 
absences due to symptoms are common. In severe cases, children may display regression 
of behaviour and extreme impairment – for example, affecting self-care and mobility.
•	 In children and adolescents, parental or caregiver responses to symptoms can affect the 
course and severity of bodily distress disorder, as well as whether medical attention is 
sought. For example, excessive parental or caregiver concern can worsen the severity or 
prolong the course of the disorder in children.
•	 Older adults with bodily distress disorder are more likely than younger adults with 
the condition to have multiple bodily symptoms, and symptoms are more likely to be 
persistent. The diagnosis of bodily distress disorder in older adults can be challenging due 
to the higher likelihood of medical conditions that may account for symptoms, or that are 
comorbid with bodily distress disorder.
Culture-related features
•	 Somatic symptoms are common in all cultural groups, especially among people seeking 
health care. Differences in rates of bodily symptoms may be related to cultural reporting 
styles. Differences may also reflect the organizational culture of the health-care system, 
with somatic complaints more likely where clinical encounters are brief and the delivery of 
services is less person-centred.
•	 Symptoms that are common in one cultural group may be less common in other groups. 
For example, whereas pain symptoms are common across cultures, symptoms such as 
heat in the body or in the head, crawling sensations, heaviness, or complaints of “gas” or 
abdominal bloating are common in certain cultural group but not in others.
•	 Culture may influence explanatory models, with symptoms variously attributed to forms 
of bodily energy, humours or other ethno-physiological concepts, as well as religious, 
spiritual, personal, family or environmental stresses. Some specific attributions, such as 
symptoms being caused by semen loss or kidney weakness, are common in certain cultural 
group but not in others.
•	 Across cultural groups, people with multiple distressing bodily symptoms are likely to seek 
health care, including from traditional or faith healers. However, help-seeking behaviour 
is also substantially influenced by access to health-care services. Individuals may not have 
extensive interactions with the formal health-care system because of limited opportunities 
to access health care, which varies substantially by cultural group.
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Bodily distress disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Prevalence rates do not appear to differ by gender prior to puberty, after which prevalence 
is higher in females.
•	 Symptom presentation may vary by gender, with women more likely to report multiple 
bodily concerns.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with mood disorders
Among individuals with mood disorders, somatic symptoms may be the dominant aspects of 
the clinical presentation – particularly in primary care settings. In addition, some individuals 
with mood disorders may develop neurovegetative symptoms (e.g. weight loss, fatigue) or other 
associated physical symptoms (e.g. pain), about which they become preoccupied. Bodily distress 
disorder should be diagnosed only if the preoccupation with physical symptoms occurs outside 
the context of mood episodes – for example, if the preoccupation precedes a depressive episode 
or persists after the depressive episode has remitted.
Boundary with generalized anxiety disorder
Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder may report somatic symptoms about which they 
are concerned (e.g. palpitations or gastric distress), but they also report concerns about negative 
events occurring in several different aspects of everyday life (e.g. work, relationships, finance). 
Unlike individuals with bodily distress disorder, individuals with generalized anxiety disorder 
do not typically exhibit a preoccupation with bodily symptoms that persists despite medical 
evaluation and reassurance. However, co-occurrence of bodily distress disorder and anxiety and 
fear-related disorders is common, although individuals with bodily distress disorder are less likely 
to endorse the psychological components of anxiety other than distress about their bothersome 
symptoms.
Boundary with panic disorder
Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected, self-limited episodes of intense fear 
or apprehension with prominent somatic symptoms and feelings of an impending catastrophe 
(e.g. fainting, having a stroke, heart attack or dying), with a sense of immediacy of the threat. 
Individuals with panic disorder often become preoccupied with the transient somatic symptoms 
they experience during panic attacks, and may express concern that they are dangerous and 
suggestive of imminent harm. An additional diagnosis of bodily distress disorder should not be 
assigned on the basis of concern about symptoms experienced during panic attacks. However, if 
individuals with panic disorder are excessively attentive to or preoccupied by persistent somatic 
symptoms that are distinct from those typically associated with panic attacks, and all diagnostic 
requirements for both disorders are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Bodily distress disorder

Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
Unlike individuals with hypochondriasis, who are preoccupied with the possibility of having one 
or more serious, progressive or life-threatening illnesses, individuals with bodily distress disorder 
are typically preoccupied by the symptoms themselves and the impact of the symptoms on 
their lives. Individuals with hypochondriasis may also seek medical attention, but their primary 
purpose is to obtain reassurance that they do not have the feared serious medical condition. 
Individuals with bodily distress disorder typically seek medical attention in order to get relief 
from their symptoms, not to disconfirm the belief that they have a serious medical illness.
Boundary with factitious disorder imposed on self
Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self may also present bodily symptoms. If the 
presented symptoms have been feigned, falsified or intentionally induced or aggravated, factitious 
disorder imposed on self rather than bodily distress disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.
Body integrity dysphoria
Essential (required) features
•	 An intense and persistent desire to become physically disabled in a significant way (e.g. a 
major limb amputation, paraplegia, blindness) accompanied by persistent discomfort or 
intense negative feelings about one’s current body configuration or functioning, is required 
for diagnosis.
•	 The desire to be disabled results in harmful consequences, manifested in either or both of 
the following:
•	 attempts to actually become disabled through self-injury, which have resulted in the 
person putting their health or life in significant jeopardy;
•	 preoccupation with the desire to be disabled, resulting in significant impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning 
(e.g. avoidance of close relationships, interference with work productivity).
•	 Onset of the persistent desire to be disabled occurs by early adolescence.
•	 The disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder – in which, for example, a delusional conviction 
that the limb belongs to another person may be present – or factitious disorder) or by 
malingering.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not better accounted for by gender incongruence, by a 
disease of the nervous system or by another medical condition.
6C21
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 It is common for individuals to describe their discomfort in terms of feeling like they 
should have been born with the desired disability (e.g. missing a leg).
•	 Most individuals with this condition exhibit associated “pretending” or simulation 
behaviour (e.g. binding one’s leg to simulate being a person with a limb amputation, or 
using a wheelchair or crutches), which is often the first manifestation of the condition. 
These behaviours are usually done in secret. The need for secrecy may result in avoidance 
or termination of intimate relationships that would interfere with opportunities 
for simulation.
•	 Some individuals who attempt to make themselves disabled through self-injury try to 
cover up the self-inflicted nature of the attempt by making it look like an accident.
•	 Many individuals with body integrity dysphoria have a sexual component to their desire 
– either being sexually attracted to individuals with certain disabilities or being intensely 
sexually aroused at the thought of being disabled.
•	 Shame about the desire to be disabled is common in individuals with body integrity 
dysphoria, and most individuals keep this desire a closely guarded secret because of a fear 
of being rejected or thought to be “crazy” by others. It is common for the family, friends, 
co-workers and even their partners or spouses of individuals with body integrity dysphoria 
to be unaware of their desire. Some may seek treatment for associated depressive or other 
symptoms and yet not share their desire to be disabled with their health-care provider.
•	 It is assumed that most individuals with body integrity dysphoria never come to clinical 
attention. When they do, it is generally as adults – often when they seek the assistance 
of a health-care professional to relieve their distress, to help them actualize their desired 
disability, or because they have injured themselves in an attempt to become disabled.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Some individuals, especially children and adolescents, may have time-limited periods in 
which they pretend to have a disability such as blindness out of curiosity about what it is 
like to live as a disabled person. Such individuals do not experience a persistent desire to 
become disabled or the harmful consequences associated with body integrity dysphoria.
Course features
•	 The typical course is for the intensity of the desire to become disabled and consequent 
functional impairment to wax and wane. There may be periods of time where the intensity 
of the desire and the accompanying dysphoria is so great that the individual can think of 
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria

Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience
nothing else, and may make plans or take action to become disabled. At other times, the 
desire to become disabled and the associated intense negative feelings abate, although at 
no time does it completely cease to be present.
Developmental presentations
•	 The onset of body integrity dysphoria is most commonly in early to mid-childhood, 
although some cases have their onset in adolescence. The first manifestation is typically 
the child pretending to have the desired disability, often in secret.
Culture-related features
•	 Although apparently quite rare, cases have been reported in many different countries 
and cultures.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Among those who come to clinical attention, prevalence appears to be higher among males.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizophrenia, other primary psychotic disorders, and other mental 
disorders with psychotic symptoms
Somatic delusions may involve the conviction that a part of the person’s body does not belong 
to them. In such cases, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, or a 
mood disorder with psychotic symptoms should be considered. Individuals with body integrity 
dysphoria do not harbour false beliefs about external reality related to their desire to be disabled, 
and thus are not considered to be delusional. Instead, they experience an internal feeling that they 
would be “right” only if they were disabled.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by repetitive and persistent thoughts, images or 
urges that are experienced as intrusive and unwanted (ego-dystonic). In contrast, the repetitive 
Disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience | Body integrity dysphoria

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

thoughts, images and impulses related to the desire to become disabled in body integrity 
dysphoria (e.g. fantasies of being disabled) are ego-syntonic, and are not experienced as intrusive, 
unwanted or distressing. Distress in body integrity dysphoria is typically related to not being able 
to actualize the disability, or to fear of the negative judgements of others.
Boundary with body dysmorphic disorder
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have persistent preoccupations about a part of their 
body that they believe is defective, or a perception that their appearance overall is ugly. In contrast, 
individuals with body integrity dysphoria are persistently preoccupied with a sense that the way 
their body is configured (e.g. for those who desire an amputation) or functions (e.g. for those who 
want to be paraplegic or blind) is wrong, unnatural and not as it should be.
Boundary with paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individual
Some individuals have a paraphilic focus of intense sexual arousal involving the fantasy of 
having a serious disability, which may be associated with transient periods of wanting to acquire 
the disability that is the source of arousal. If the desire to acquire a disability occurs solely in 
connection with sexual arousal, body integrity dysphoria should not be diagnosed. A diagnosis 
of paraphilic disorder involved solitary behaviour or consenting individuals may be appropriate 
in such cases, if the individual is markedly distressed about this arousal pattern or if they have 
injured themselves as a part of enacting sexual fantasies related to it.
Boundary with factitious disorder and malingering
Individuals with body integrity disorder often simulate their desired disability as a way of 
reducing their negative feelings (e.g. a person who desires to be paraplegic may spend part or all 
of their time using a wheelchair). Moreover, they typically shun medical attention. In contrast, 
individuals with factitious disorder feign medical or psychological signs or symptoms in order to 
seek attention – especially from health-care providers – and to assume the sick role. Malingering 
is characterized by feigning of medical or psychological signs or symptoms for obvious external 
incentives (e.g. disability payments).
Boundary with diseases of the nervous system
Some diseases of the nervous system may cause symptoms that involve profound changes in the 
person’s attitude towards and experience of their own bodies (e.g. somatoparaphrenia, in which 
a paralysed body part is experienced as alien or as belonging to someone else.) If the persistent 
discomfort about the individual’s body configuration is better accounted for by a disease of the 
nervous system, then body integrity dysphoria should not be diagnosed.

Other specified disorder of bodily distress or bodily experience
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by disturbances in the person’s experience of their 
body that share primary clinical features with other disorders of bodily distress or bodily 
experience (e.g. distressing bodily symptoms to which excessive attention is directed, or 
intense feelings of inappropriateness concerning one’s body configuration or functioning).
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
disorders of bodily distress or bodily experience grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or

psychotic disorder, an eating disorder).
•	 The symptoms have persisted for at least several months.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally appropriate (e.g. focused on bodily 
changes during puberty) or culturally sanctioned.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not accounted for by gender incongruence or by another

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Disorders due to substance 
use or addictive behaviours
Disorders due to substance use
Disorders due to substance use include disorders that result from a single occasion or repeated 
use of substances that have psychoactive properties, including certain medications. Disorders 
related to 14 classes or groups of psychoactive substances that have important clinical and public 
health consequences are included, and categories are also available for other specified substances.
Typically, initial use of these substances produces pleasant or appealing psychoactive effects that 
are rewarding, and this response is reinforced with repeated use. With continued use, many of the 
substances included here have the capacity to produce dependence. They also have the potential 
to cause numerous forms of harm – to both mental and physical health. Disorders due to harmful 
nonmedical use of non-psychoactive substances (e.g. laxatives, growth hormone, erythropoietin 
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are also included in this grouping.
General cultural considerations for disorders due to substance use
•	 Use of psychoactive substances is influenced by strong cultural meanings and traditions, 
which may affect the risk of development of a disorder due to substance use. The cultural 
milieu in which the substance is used should be considered when determining risk and 
the presence or absence of pathology. For example, substances may be used regularly as 
part of religious rituals, celebrations (e.g. New Year’s Eve), culturally sanctioned mystical 
experiences, specific events (e.g. wakes preceding funerals) or healing activities without 
resulting in a disorder due to substance use.
•	 Cultural values and interpretations related to the use of psychoactive substances in 
specific communities, and cultural terms used to describe the substance and its effects, 
vary greatly across cultures. Knowledge of specific terms and interpretations will improve 
communication with patients and determination of possible disorder. For example, 
American Indians who use peyote during traditional worship ceremonies may consider 
the substance a sacrament rather than a drug.
Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Local availability of a substance affects the prevalence of disorders associated with it. For 
example, prevalence of alcohol dependence is lower in predominantly Muslim countries 
due to the religious prohibitions against alcohol consumption.
•	 Immigration may affect an individual’s pattern of substance as a result of changes in culture, 
including gender roles. Such changes can lead to higher or lower risk of disorders due to 
substance use depending on the characteristics of the sending and receiving societies, the 
circumstances of migration, and the relative social position in each setting. For example, 
immigrants moving from a society with high alcohol consumption to one with low alcohol 
consumption tend to assume the lower risk of disorder of the host country.
Substance classes
Disorders due to substance use are classified by first identifying the substance used. Available 
substance classes included are listed below, with a brief description of their properties, typical 
preparations and methods of use, as well as associated harms and disorders.
Disorders due to use of alcohol
Disorders due to use of alcohol are characterized by the pattern and consequences of alcohol 
use. Alcohol – more specifically termed ethyl alcohol or ethanol – is an intoxicating compound 
produced by fermentation of sugars, usually in agricultural products such as fruits, cereals and 
vegetables, with or without subsequent distillation. There are a wide variety of alcoholic drinks, 
with alcohol concentrations typically ranging from 1.5% to 60%. Alcohol is predominantly a 
central nervous system depressant. Unlike most other substances, elimination of alcohol from 
the body occurs at a constant rate, such that its clearance follows a linear rather than a logarithmic 
course. In addition to ability to produce alcohol intoxication, alcohol has dependence-producing 
properties, resulting in alcohol dependence in some people and alcohol withdrawal when alcohol 
use is reduced or discontinued.
Alcohol is implicated in a wide range of harms affecting most organs and systems of the body 
(e.g. cirrhosis of the liver, gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatitis). Harm to others resulting from 
behaviour during alcohol intoxication is well recognized, and is included in the definitions of 
categories of harmful use of alcohol (i.e. episode of harmful use of alcohol and harmful pattern 
of use of alcohol). Several alcohol-induced mental disorders (e.g. alcohol-induced psychotic 
disorder) and alcohol-related forms of neurocognitive impairment (e.g. dementia due to use of 
alcohol) are also recognized.
Alcohol use is one of the most common causes of premature death and illness among men, and 
is still a substantial – though less common – cause of premature death and illness among women. 
The use of alcohol is implicated in millions of deaths per year (e.g. due to motor vehicle accidents).
Although alcohol is used worldwide, and its use is legal among adults in most countries, there are 
substantial differences in cultural and religious acceptability of its use. Consequently, prevalence 
6C40
Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours | Substance classes

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
of alcohol use disorders shows substantial regional variation; the highest prevalence is observed 
in eastern Europe and the lowest in Africa. Low prevalence of alcohol use in some countries is 
related to lower rates of disorders due to use of alcohol.
Polymorphisms of the genes for the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase 
(ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase, which affect the response to alcohol, are seen more 
frequently among East Asians than other groups. Individuals with certain polymorphisms may 
develop facial flushing and palpitations when consuming alcohol, which may be so severe as to 
preclude alcohol consumption and thus lower the risk of alcohol use disorder.
Disorders due to use of cannabis
Disorders due to use of cannabis are characterized by the pattern and consequences of cannabis 
use. Cannabis is the collective term for a range of psychoactive preparations of the cannabis 
plant, Cannabis sativa, and related species and hybrids. Cannabis contains cannabinoids, 
a class of diverse chemical compounds that act on endogenous cannabinoid receptors that 
modulate neurotransmitter release in the brain. The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is 
δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabis is typically smoked in the form of the flowering heads 
or leaves of the marijuana plant; tobacco is often mixed with cannabis when smoked. Cannabis 
oils are also prepared from these same sources. These preparations vary considerably in their 
THC potency. Cannabis has predominantly central nervous system depressant effects; it produces 
a characteristic euphoria that may be part of the presenting features of cannabis intoxication, 
which may also include impairment in cognitive and psychomotor functioning. Cannabis 
has dependence-producing properties resulting in cannabis dependence in some people and 
cannabis withdrawal when use is reduced or discontinued. Cannabis is associated with a range of 
cannabis-induced mental disorders. Other medical conditions are also associated with cannabis 
use, including some respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide, but its legal status varies considerably; 
in certain countries it is legally available for medicinal or personal use. Acceptance of cannabis 
use for recreational or medical purposes also varies widely by culture. Variations in legal status 
and cultural acceptability are related to differential consequences for detection of use (e.g. arrest, 
school suspension or employment suspension), affecting the probability that the person may 
seek treatment.
Disorders due to use of synthetic cannabinoids
Disorders due to use of synthetic cannabinoids are characterized by the pattern and consequences 
of synthetic cannabinoid use. Synthetic cannabinoids are synthesized diverse chemical 
compounds that are potent agonists for endogenous cannabinoid receptors. There are several 
hundred such compounds. The synthetic compound is typically sprayed onto a vehicle such as 
cannabis or tea leaves and then smoked. The effect of these compounds is distinctly different from 
smoking naturally cultivated cannabis, in that the euphoric effects are typically accompanied 
or dominated by psychotic-like symptoms (e.g. paranoia, hallucinations and disorganized

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

behaviour). Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication may therefore present more frequently with 
psychotic symptoms in addition to the more typical effects of cannabis. Synthetic cannabinoids 
also have dependence-producing properties, and synthetic cannabinoid dependence and synthetic 
cannabinoid withdrawal are recognized. Synthetic cannabinoid-induced mental disorders also 
occur; in particular, synthetic cannabinoid-induced psychotic disorder is recognized. Much less 
is known about the effects of these drugs on other body organs and systems than is the case for 
naturally cultivated cannabis.
Disorders due to use of opioids
Disorders due to use of opioids are characterized by the pattern and consequences of opioid use. 
“Opioids” is a generic term that encompasses the constituents or derivatives of the opium poppy, 
Papaver somniferum, as well as a range of synthetic and semisynthetic compounds – some related 
to morphine and others chemically distinct, but all having their primary actions on the µ opioid 
receptor. Examples of opioids include morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), fentanyl, pethidine, 
oxycodone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, codeine and d-propoxyphene. The 
opioids all have analgesic properties of different potencies, and are primarily central nervous 
system depressants. They suppress respiration and other vital functions, and are a common cause 
of overdose and related deaths. Certain opioids are used or administered parenterally, including 
heroin – a common and potent opioid that is primarily used nonmedically. Therapeutic opioids 
are prescribed for a range of indications worldwide, and are essential for pain management in 
cancer care and palliative care, although they are also used for nontherapeutic reasons. In some 
countries, morbidity and mortality related to therapeutic opioids are greater than those related to 
heroin. All opioids may result in opioid intoxication, opioid dependence and opioid withdrawal. 
A range of opioid-induced disorders occur, some of which occur following opioid withdrawal. 
Because certain opioids are commonly injected illicitly, their use is a potent mechanism of 
transmission of bloodborne viral infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS, as 
well as bacterial infections. Not including alcohol and tobacco, opioids are the most common 
cause of death from psychoactive drug use worldwide.
Disorders due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics
Disorders due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics are characterized by the pattern 
and consequences of use of these substances. Sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics are typically 
prescribed for the short-term treatment of anxiety or insomnia, and are also employed to provide 
sedation for medical procedures. They include benzodiazepines and the non-benzodiazepine 
positive allosteric modulators of GABA receptors (i.e. “Z-drugs”), as well as many other 
compounds. Sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics include barbiturates, which are available 
much less commonly now than in previous decades. Sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics have 
dependence-inducing properties that are related to the dose and duration of their use. They 
may cause intoxication, dependence and withdrawal. Several other mental disorders induced by 
sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics are recognized.

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours | Substance classes 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Disorders due to use of cocaine
Disorders due to use of cocaine are characterized by the pattern and consequences of cocaine 
use. Cocaine is a compound found in the leaves of the coca plant, Erythroxylum coca, which is 
indigenous to countries in northern regions of South America. Cocaine has a limited place in 
medical treatment as an anaesthetic and vasoconstrictive agent. It is commonly used illicitly, and 
is widely available across the world, where it is found in two main forms: cocaine hydrochloride 
and cocaine freebase (also known as “crack”). Cocaine is a central nervous system stimulant, and 
cocaine intoxication typically includes a state of euphoria and hyperactivity. Cocaine has potent 
dependence-producing properties, and cocaine dependence is a common cause of morbidity and 
of clinical presentations. Cocaine withdrawal has a characteristic course that includes lethargy 
and depressed mood. A range of cocaine-induced mental disorders is described. Cocaine is also 
associated with several health sequelae, including myocardial infarction arising from coronary 
artery spasm and stroke arising from cerebral artery spasm.
Disorders due to use of stimulants, including amfetamines, 
methamfetamine and methcathinone
Disorders due to use of stimulants, including amfetamines, methamfetamine and methcathinone, 
are characterized by the pattern and consequences of use of these substances. There is a wide 
array of naturally occurring and synthetically produced psychostimulants other than cocaine. The 
most numerous of this group are the amfetamine-type substances, including methamfetamine. 
Prescribed stimulants including dexamfetamine are indicated for a limited number of conditions, 
such as for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Methcathinone, known in many countries as 
ephedrone, is a synthetic potent stimulant that is a structural analogue of methamfetamine and 
is related to cathinone. All these drugs have primarily psychostimulant properties and are also 
vasoconstrictors to a varying degree. They induce euphoria and hyperactivity, as may be seen in 
stimulant intoxication. They have potent dependence-producing properties, which may lead to 
the diagnosis of stimulant dependence and stimulant withdrawal following the cessation of use. 
Several stimulant-induced mental disorders are described. Stimulants are a widespread cause of 
hospitalization and clinic attendance, and significant causes of morbidity and mortality, often due 
to violence related to stimulant-induced psychotic disorder.
Disorders due to use of synthetic cathinones
Disorders due to use of synthetic cathinones are characterized by the pattern and consequences 
of synthetic cathinone use. Synthetic cathinones (also known as “bath salts”) are synthetic 
compounds with stimulant properties related to cathinone found in the khat plant, Catha edulis. 
The use of synthetic cathinones is common in young populations in many countries. They may 
produce a range of disorders including synthetic cathinone intoxication, synthetic cathinone 
dependence and synthetic cathinone withdrawal. Several synthetic cathinone-induced mental 
disorders are recognized.

Disorders due to use of caffeine
Disorders due to use of caffeine are characterized by the pattern and consequences of caffeine use. 
Caffeine is a mild psychostimulant and diuretic that is found in the beans of the coffee plant (Coffea 
species), and is a constituent of coffee, cola drinks, chocolate, a range of proprietary “energy drinks” 
and weight-loss aids. It is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide, and several 
clinical conditions related to its use are described, although severe disorders are comparatively 
rare considering its ubiquity. Caffeine intoxication related to consumption of relatively high doses 
(i.e. >1 g per day) is described. Caffeine withdrawal is common upon cessation of use among 
individuals who have used caffeine for a prolonged period or in large amounts. Caffeine-induced 
anxiety disorder has been described, often following intoxication or heavy use.
Disorders due to use of hallucinogens
Disorders due to use of hallucinogens are characterized by the pattern and consequences of 
hallucinogen use. Several thousand compounds have hallucinogenic properties, many of which 
are found in plants (e.g. mescaline) and fungi (e.g. psilocybin) or are chemically synthesized (e.g. 
LSD). These compounds have primarily hallucinogenic properties, but some may also be stimulants. 
Much of the morbidity associated with these compounds arises from the acute effects related 
to hallucinogen intoxication. Hallucinogen dependence is rare, and hallucinogen withdrawal is 
not described. Among the mental disorders related to hallucinogen use, hallucinogen-induced 
psychotic disorder is the most frequently seen, although worldwide it is still fairly uncommon.
Disorders due to use of nicotine
Disorders due to use of nicotine are characterized by the pattern and consequences of nicotine 
use. Nicotine is the active dependence-producing constituent of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana 
tabacum. Nicotine is used overwhelmingly through smoking cigarettes. Increasingly, it is also 
used in electronic cigarettes that vaporize nicotine dissolved in a carrier solvent for inhalation (i.e. 
“vaping”). Pipe smoking, chewing tobacco and inhaling snuff are minor forms of use. Nicotine 
is a highly potent addictive compound, and is the third most common psychoactive substance 
used worldwide after caffeine and alcohol. Nicotine dependence and nicotine withdrawal are 
well described, and nicotine-induced mental disorders are recognized. Tobacco is by far the 
most important cause worldwide of morbidity and mortality of all the psychoactive substances; 
this is due in part to its addictive constituent nicotine but more so to other constituents such 
as carcinogens and other hazardous and harmful compounds that are inhaled during smoking. 
Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of ill health and premature death among men, and is among 
the top 10 causes in women.

Disorders due to use of volatile inhalants
Disorders due to use of volatile inhalants are characterized by the pattern and consequences of 
volatile inhalant use. Volatile inhalants include a range of compounds that are in the gaseous or 
vapour phase at ambient temperatures, such as various organic solvents, glues, gasoline (petrol), 
nitrites and gases such as nitrous oxide, trichloroethane, butane, toluene, fluorocarbons, ether 
and halothane. They have a range of pharmacological properties but are predominantly central 
nervous system depressants, with many also having vasoactive effects. They tend to be used by 
younger people, and may be used when access to alternative psychoactive substances is difficult or 
impossible. Volatile inhalant intoxication is well recognized. Volatile inhalants have dependence-
producing properties, and volatile inhalant dependence and volatile inhalant withdrawal 
are recognized, although comparatively uncommon worldwide. Volatile inhalant-induced 
mental disorders are described. Volatile inhalants may also cause neurocognitive impairment, 
including dementia.
Disorders due to use of MDMA or related drugs, including MDA
Disorders due to use of 3,4-Methyl​enedioxy​methamfetamine (MDMA) or related drugs, including 
methylenedioxyamfetamine (MDA), are characterized by the pattern and consequences of MDMA 
or related drug use. MDMA is a common drug of abuse in many countries especially among 
young people. It is predominantly available in tablet form known as “ecstasy”. Pharmacologically, 
MDMA has stimulant and empathogenic properties, and these encourage its use among young 
people for social and other interactions. Considering its wide prevalence in many countries and 
among many subgroups of young people, MDMA and related drug dependence and MDMA and 
related drug withdrawal are comparatively uncommon. Substance-induced mental disorders may 
arise from its use, and health sequelae are recognized, including liver disease and hyponatraemia, 
which may be fatal. Several analogues of MDMA exist, including MDA.
Disorders due to use of dissociative drugs, including ketamine and 
phencyclidine (PCP)
Disorders due to use of dissociative drugs, including ketamine and PCP, are characterized by 
the pattern and consequences of dissociative drug use. Dissociative drugs include ketamine and 
PCP and their (comparatively rare) chemical analogues. Ketamine is an intravenous anaesthetic 
widely used in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, and in emergency 
situations. Ketamine is also undergoing evaluation for treatment of some mental disorders (e.g. 
treatment-resistant depressive disorders). It is also a widespread drug of nonmedical use in 
many countries, and may be taken by the oral or nasal routes or injected. It produces a sense of 
euphoria but, depending on the dose, emergent hallucinations and dissociation are recognized 
as unpleasant side-effects. Phencyclidine has a more restricted worldwide distribution, and also 
has euphoric and dissociative effects. Its use may result in bizarre behaviour uncharacteristic for 
the individual, including self-harm. Dissociative drug dependence is described, but a withdrawal 
syndrome is not recognized by most authorities. Several dissociative drug-induced mental 
disorders are recognized.

Disorders due to use of other specified psychoactive substances, 
including medications
Disorders due to use of other specified psychoactive substances, including medications, are 
characterized by the pattern and consequences of psychoactive substances that are not included 
among the major substance classes specifically identified above. Examples include khat, anabolic 
steroids, antidepressants, medications with anticholinergic properties (e.g. benztropine) and 
some antihistamines.
Disorders due to use of multiple specified psychoactive substances, 
including medications
The categories in this grouping are provided for coding purposes. However, in most clinical 
situations it is recommended that multiple categories from disorders due to substance use should 
be assigned if these can be discerned, rather than using categories from this grouping. Doing so 
will provide more useful information for both clinical and coding purposes.
Disorders due to use of unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substances
These categories apply in clinical situations in which it is clear that the disturbance is due to 
substance use but the specific substance or class of substances is initially unknown. As more 
information becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant) the 
diagnosis should be changed to indicate the relevant substance or substance class.
Disorders due to use of non-psychoactive substances
Disorders due to use of non-psychoactive substances are characterized by the pattern and 
consequences of nonmedical use of non-psychoactive substances. Non-psychoactive substances 
include laxatives, growth hormone, erythropoietin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
They may also include proprietary or over-the-counter medicines and folk remedies. Nonmedical 
use of these substances may be associated with harm to the individual due to the direct or 
secondary toxic effects of the non-psychoactive substance on body organs and systems, or a 
harmful route of administration (e.g. infections due to intravenous self-administration). They 
are not associated with intoxication or with a dependence or withdrawal syndrome, and are not 
recognized causes of substance-induced mental disorders.

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Diagnostic categories that apply to the various classes 
of psychoactive substances
Specific diagnostic categories that apply to the classes of psychoactive substances listed above are 
as follows:
•	 Episode of harmful psychoactive substance use
•	 Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use
•	 Substance dependence
•	 Substance intoxication
•	 Substance withdrawal
•	 Substance-induced delirium
•	 Substance-induced psychotic disorder
•	 Substance-induced mood disorder
•	 Substance-induced anxiety disorder
•	 Substance-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder
•	 Substance-induced impulse control disorder
•	 Other specified disorder due to substance use
•	 Disorder due to substance use, unspecified.
Additional categories of disorders induced by psychoactive substances are included in other parts 
of this chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders. These categories relate 
to substance-induced catatonia, substance-induced amnestic disorder and substance-induced 
dementia. They are cross-listed in the section below on substance-induced mental disorders 
for reference.
Note that not all possible combinations of disorder and substance class are included in the 
classification. For example, there is no category for substance withdrawal due to dissociative 
drugs, including ketamine and PCP, and no category for nicotine-induced psychotic disorder. 
Allowable categories by substance class for episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, 
harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, substance dependence, substance intoxication 
and substance withdrawal are shown in Table 6.13 (p. 450). Allowable categories by substance 
class for substance-induced mental disorders (substance-induced delirium, substance-induced 
psychotic disorder, substance-induced mood disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, 
substance-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder and substance-induced impulse 
control disorder) are shown in Table 6.14 (p. 454).
CDDR are provided below for each type of disorder, together with a list of applicable substance 
classes. Information specific to particular substance classes is also provided when applicable.
The first three diagnoses listed above (episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful 
pattern of psychoactive substance use and substance dependence) describe the use pattern of the 
substance. One of these three diagnoses – or disorder due to substance use, unspecified, for cases 
in which the use pattern in unknown at the time of evaluation – is considered to be the primary 
diagnosis. That is, one of these four diagnoses should be assigned when making a diagnosis of a 
disorder due to substance use.
Diagnostic categories that apply to the various classes of psychoactive substances

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The remaining diagnoses reflect the impact of the substance use pattern, and are thus considered 
to be associated with one of the primary use pattern diagnoses. These diagnoses should therefore 
be assigned together with the relevant primary diagnosis. For example, 6C49.1/6C49.5 is harmful 
pattern of use of hallucinogens associated with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder, 
6C43.2/6C43.70 is opioid dependence associated with opioid-induced mood disorder, and 
6C4Z/6C40.3 is disorder due to substance use, unspecified, associated with alcohol intoxication 
(i.e. the pattern of use in this last case is unknown).
Also listed in this section are categories related to hazardous substance use. These categories 
are not considered to be mental disorders, but may be used when the pattern of substance use 
appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences, to the user or 
to others, to an extent that warrants attention and advice from health professionals, but no overt 
harm has yet occurred.

Essential (required) features
•	 An episode of use of a psychoactive substance that has caused clinically significant 
damage to a person’s physical health (e.g. bloodborne infection from intravenous self-
administration) or mental health (e.g. substance-induced mood disorder), or has resulted 
in behaviour leading to harm to the health of others, is required for diagnosis.
•	 Harm to the health of the individual occurs due to one or more of the following: behaviour 
related to intoxication (see Table 6.15, p. 475); direct or secondary toxic effects on body 
organs and systems; or a harmful route of administration.
•	 Harm to the health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma, or 
mental disorder that is directly attributable to behaviour due to substance intoxication on 
the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance 
use applies.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Episode of harmful psychoactive substance use

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The harm to health is not better accounted for by another medical condition or another 
mental disorder, including another disorder due to substance use (e.g. substance 
withdrawal).
Note: harm to the health of the person to whom the diagnosis applies includes injuries caused by 
behaviour related to intoxication (e.g. impulsive aggressive behaviour, psychomotor impairment 
leading to injury; see Table 6.15, p. 475), acute health problems resulting from substance use 
(e.g. overdose, acute gastritis, the effects of hypoxia or prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity), and 
exacerbation or decompensation of pre-existing chronic health problems (e.g. hypertension, liver 
disease or peptic ulceration). Harm may also result from a harmful route of administration (e.g. 
injecting drug use causing bloodborne virus infections, cocaine use causing a perforated nasal 
septum). The relevant diagnostic codes from other ICD-11 chapters – including Chapter 22 on 
injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes – should be used to describe 
the specific health consequences of the harmful substance use.
Harm to the health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma (e.g. impaired 
driving causing a motor vehicle accident, assaultive behaviour leading to bodily harm to another 
person) or mental disorder (e.g. post-traumatic stress disorder arising from an assault by the 
intoxicated individual) that is directly attributable to behaviour due to substance intoxication 
on the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance 
use applies.
Additional clinical features
•	 There must be explicit evidence of harm to the individual’s physical or mental health, or 
of substance-related behaviour due to intoxication that has led to harm to the physical or 
mental health of others. There must also be a clear causal relationship between the harm to 
health and the episode of substance use in question.
•	 The likelihood of harm to self or others due behaviour related to intoxication varies 
substantially by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475). For example, such behaviour is unlikely 
to arise from caffeine or nicotine intoxication.
•	 Psychoactive substance use commonly occurs in the context of other mental disorders. 
An additional diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use can be made 
if the index episode of substance use has resulted in clinically significant harm to the 
individual’s physical health, or has exacerbated or triggered an episode of a pre-existing 
mental disorder (e.g. a manic or depressive episode or a psychotic episode).
•	 A diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use often signals an opportunity 
for intervention – typically a low-intensity intervention that can be implemented in a 
wide range of settings, which is specifically aimed at reducing the likelihood of additional 
harmful episodes or of progression to harmful pattern of use or substance dependence.
•	 A diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use of unknown or unspecified 
psychoactive substances can be assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown. 
As more information becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral 
informant) the diagnosis should be changed to indicate the substance responsible for the 
episode of harm.
•	 As more information becomes available indicating that the episode is part of a continuous 
or recurrent pattern of substance use, or if additional harmful episodes occur, a diagnosis 
of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use should be changed to harmful pattern of 
psychoactive substance use or substance dependence, as appropriate.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Episode of harmful psychoactive substance use

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use requires clinically 
significant harm to the individual’s physical or mental health or the health of others. 
Examples of impact on physical or mental health that would not be considered clinically 
significant include mild hangover, brief episodes of vomiting, or transient depressed mood.
•	 A range of social problems may be associated with an episode of substance use that are not 
sufficiently severe to constitute clinically significant harm to physical or mental health (e.g. 
missed appointments, arguments with loved ones). Such problems are not a sufficient basis 
for a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hazardous substance use
Hazardous substance use is classified in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact 
with health services and not in this chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Hazardous substance use appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental 
health consequences, to the user or to others, to an extent that warrants attention and advice from 
health professionals, but has not resulted in specific identifiable harm and therefore does not meet 
the diagnostic requirements for episode of harmful psychoactive substance use.
Boundary with harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use
If the harm to health is a result of a known episodic or continuous pattern of substance use, and all 
other diagnostic requirements are met, a diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance 
use should be assigned. Substance use is generally considered to be following a pattern if there has 
been at least episodic or intermittent use over a period of at least 12 months. If harm is caused by 
use of a substance but no information is available about the pattern or history of substance use, 
a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use may be assigned until such time as 
evidence for a pattern of use is ascertained.
Boundary with substance dependence
In substance dependence, individuals use a substance or substances persistently, despite harm 
and adverse consequences. Harm caused by such use may be similar to that observed in episode 
of harmful psychoactive substance use. However, substance dependence also includes additional 
features of impaired ability to control use and increasing priority given to the substance use over 
other activities. Physiological features (e.g. tolerance) may also be present for applicable substances. 
If all diagnostic requirements for substance dependence are met for a particular substance, episode 
of harmful psychoactive substance use should not be assigned for that substance. Note: substance 
dependence is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.13, p. 450).
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Episode of harmful psychoactive substance use

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with substance intoxication
Substance intoxication is defined by substance use that results in clinically significant transient 
substance-specific symptoms (see Table 6.15, p. 475). Recovery from substance intoxication is 
generally complete and without physical or mental sequelae. If there is continuing damage or harm 
(e.g. the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity, tissue damage) due 
to an episode of substance intoxication, a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance 
use may be assigned. If relevant at the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), 
episode of harmful psychoactive substance use may be diagnosed with an associated diagnosis of 
substance intoxication.
Boundary with substance-induced mental disorders
Substance-induced mental disorders can be associated with a single episode of substance use. 
If a substance-induced mental disorder has occurred as a form of harm resulting from a single 
episode of substance use, both episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and the relevant 
substance-induced mental disorder should be diagnosed (e.g. episode of harmful cocaine use 
with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder). Note: specific substance-induced mental disorders are 
only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).
Boundary with overdose
When ingestion of psychoactive substances results in symptoms of overdose (e.g. coma, life-
threatening cardiac or respiratory suppression), a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects 
of substances in Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes 
should also be assigned.

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Essential (required) features
•	 A pattern of continuous, recurrent or sporadic use of a psychoactive substance that has 
caused clinically significant damage to a person’s physical health (e.g. bloodborne infection 
from intravenous self-administration) or mental health (e.g. substance-induced mood 
disorder), or has resulted in behaviour leading to harm to the health of others is required 
for diagnosis.
•	 Harm to the health of the individual occurs due to one or more of the following: behaviour 
related to intoxication (see Table 6.15, p. 475); direct or secondary toxic effects on body 
organs and systems; or a harmful route of administration.
•	 Harm to the health of others includes any form of physical harm, including trauma, or 
mental disorder that is directly attributable to behaviour related to substance intoxication 
on the part of the person to whom the diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive 
substance use applies.
•	 The pattern of use of the relevant substance is evident over a period of at least 12 months if 
substance use is episodic, or at least 1 month if use is continuous.
•	 The harm to health is not better accounted for by another medical condition or another 
mental disorder, including another disorder due to substance use (e.g. substance 
withdrawal).
Note: harm to the health of the person to whom the diagnosis applies includes injuries caused by 
behaviour related to intoxication (e.g. impulsive aggressive behaviour, psychomotor impairment 
leading to injury; see Table 6.15, p. 475); acute health problems resulting from substance use 
(e.g. overdose, acute gastritis, the effects of hypoxia or prolonged hyperactivity or inactivity), and 
exacerbation or decompensation of pre-existing chronic health problems (e.g. hypertension, liver 
disease, or peptic ulceration). Harm may also result from a harmful route of administration (e.g. 
injecting drug use causing bloodborne virus infections, cocaine use causing a perforated nasal 
septum). The relevant diagnostic codes from other ICD-11 chapters – including Chapter 22 on

Course specifiers
A specifier is used to further describe the harmful pattern of substance use, using a fifth-character 
code. The x below corresponds to the fourth-character code indicating the substance class (0 for 
alcohol, 1 for cannabis, 2 for synthetic cannabinoids and so on).
Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, episodic
This category is assigned when all the diagnostic requirements for harmful pattern of psychoactive 
substance use are met, and there is evidence of a pattern of recurrent episodic or intermittent 
use of the relevant psychoactive substance over a period of at least 12 months that has caused 
clinically significant harm to a person’s physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour 
leading to harm to the health of others.
Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, continuous
This category is assigned when all the diagnostic requirements for harmful pattern of psychoactive 
substance use are met, and there is evidence of a pattern of continuous substance use (daily 
or almost daily) of the relevant psychoactive substance over a period of at least 1 month that 
has caused clinically significant harm to a person’s physical or mental health or has resulted in 
behaviour leading to harm to the health of others.
Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 There must be explicit evidence of harm to the individual’s physical or mental health, or 
of behaviour due to substance intoxication that has led to harm to the physical or mental 
health of others. There must also be a clear causal relationship between the harm to health 
and the episodic or continuous use of a substance.
•	 The likelihood of harm to self or others due behaviour related to intoxication varies 
substantially by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475). For example, such behaviour is unlikely 
to arise from caffeine or nicotine intoxication.
•	 A diagnosis of harmful pattern of use of unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances 
can be assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown. As more information 
becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant) the diagnosis 
should be changed to indicate the substance(s) involved in the harmful pattern of 
psychoactive substance use.
•	 As more information becomes available about symptoms and behaviours related to the 
pattern of substance use, as well as physiological features indicative of neuroadaptation

to the substance, the diagnosis may be changed to substance dependence if diagnostic 
requirements are met.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use requires clinically significant 
harm to the individual’s physical or mental health or the health of others. Examples of 
impact on physical or mental health that would not be considered clinically significant 
include mild hangovers, brief episodes of vomiting, or transient depressed mood.
•	 A pattern of psychoactive substance use may cause a range of problems in functioning 
(e.g. missed appointments, arguments with loved ones) that are not sufficiently severe to 
constitute clinically significant harm to physical or mental health. Such problems are not a 
sufficient basis for a diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use.
Developmental presentations
•	 Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use is often a characteristic of late adolescence 
and young adulthood, and injuries and the consequences of aggressive behaviour are 
particularly common in this age group.
•	 Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use in older adults may cause injuries and 
fractures due to the combination of lowered tolerance, psychomotor impairment induced 
by a substance, and disorders associated with ageing such as osteoporosis and dementia.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The prevalence of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use is higher in males, but 
the gender differential is smaller in countries where women play a greater role in the 
workforce. Gender differences in injuries and other forms of harm due to substance use 
are recognized.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hazardous substance use
Hazardous substance use is classified in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact 
with health services and not in this chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders. hazardous substance use appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental 
health consequences, to the user or to others, to an extent that warrants attention and advice from

health professionals, but has not resulted in specific identifiable harm and therefore does not meet 
the diagnostic requirements for harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use.
Boundary with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use
If the harm to health is a result of a single episode of use rather than a pattern of substance use, 
whether episodic or continuous, a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use 
should be assigned. Substance use is generally considered to be following a pattern if there has 
been at least episodic or intermittent use over a period of at least 12 months. If harm is caused by 
use of a substance but no information is available about the pattern or history of substance use, 
a diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use may be assigned until such time as 
evidence for a pattern of use is ascertained.
Boundary with substance dependence
In substance dependence, individuals use a substance or substances persistently, despite harm and 
adverse consequences. Harm caused by such use may be similar to that observed in harmful pattern 
of psychoactive substance use. However, substance dependence also includes additional features 
of impaired ability to control use and increasing priority given to the substance use over other 
activities. Physiological features (e.g. tolerance) may also be present for applicable substances. If 
all diagnostic requirements for substance dependence are met for a particular substance, Harmful 
pattern of psychoactive substance use should not be assigned for that substance. Note: substance 
dependence is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.13, p. 450).
Boundary with substance intoxication
Substance intoxication is defined by substance use that results in clinically significantly, transient 
substance-specific symptoms (see Table 6.15, p. 475). Recovery from substance intoxication is 
generally complete and absent of physical or mental sequelae. A pattern or repeated intoxication 
may or may not result in harm to a person’s physical or mental health or to the health of others. If 
there is continuing damage or harm (e.g. the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolonged hyperactivity 
or inactivity, tissue damage) as a result of repeated or continuous use of a psychoactive substance, 
a diagnosis of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use may be assigned. If relevant at 
the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), harmful pattern of psychoactive 
substance use may be diagnosed with an associated diagnosis of substance intoxication.
Boundary with substance withdrawal
Substance withdrawal occurs upon cessation or reduction of a substance in the context of 
physiological dependence, or when a substance has been taken for a prolonged period or in 
large amounts. Some features of substance withdrawal may include physical or mental harm 
(e.g. seizures, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety). If the symptoms are entirely explained by the 
withdrawal syndrome for the relevant substance (see Table 6.16, p. 484), an additional diagnosis 
of harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use is not warranted. However, if the symptoms 
substantially exceed the expected withdrawal syndrome in duration or type or severity, and the 
diagnostic requirements for substance dependence are not met, harmful pattern of psychoactive 
substance use can be assigned as the primary diagnosis, with an associated diagnosis of substance 
withdrawal (e.g. harmful pattern of use of opioids with opioid withdrawal). Note: substance 
withdrawal is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.13, p. 450).
Boundary with substance-induced mental disorders
If a substance-induced mental disorder has occurred as a form of harm resulting from a pattern 
of substance use, both harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use and the relevant substance-
induced mental disorder should be diagnosed (e.g. harmful pattern of cocaine use with cocaine-
induced anxiety disorder). Note: specific substance-induced mental disorders are only applicable 
for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Boundary with other mental disorders and other medical conditions
Numerous mental disorders and subthreshold symptoms may co-occur with episodic or 
continuous patterns of substance use. Similarly, continuous or episodic substance use increases 
the risk of mental disorders and other medical conditions. Co-occurring mental disorders and 
comorbid medical conditions should be diagnosed separately, along with a diagnosis of harmful 
pattern of psychoactive substance use.

Essential (required) features
•	 A pattern of recurrent episodic or continuous use of a psychoactive substance is required for 
diagnosis, with evidence of impaired regulation of use of that substance that is manifested 
in two or more of the following:
•	 impaired control over substance use (i.e. onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, 
context);
•	 increasing precedence of substance use over other aspects of life, including maintenance 
of health, and daily activities and responsibilities, such that substance use continues

relationship disruption, occupational or scholastic consequences, negative impact on 
health);
•	 physiological features indicative of neuroadaptation to the substance, including 
tolerance to the effects of the substance or a need to use increasing amounts 
of the substance to achieve the same effect; withdrawal symptoms following 
cessation or reduction in use of that substance; or repeated use of the substance or

pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms 
(substance-specific features of withdrawal are described in Table 6.16, p. 484). 
Note: physiological features are only applicable for certain substances.
•	 The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months, but the 
diagnosis may be made if use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.
Course specifiers for alcohol dependence
For alcohol, a specifier is used to describe the pattern of substance use or remission. Unlike for 
other substances, a distinction is made between continuous and episodic use, as follows.
Alcohol dependence, current use, continuous
The individual exhibits alcohol dependence, with continuous consumption of alcohol (daily or 
almost daily) during at least the past month.
Alcohol dependence, current use, episodic
The individual exhibits alcohol dependence, with use during the past month and a history of 
intermittent heavy drinking, with periods of abstinence during the past 12 months.
Alcohol dependence, early full remission
After a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other 
intervention (including self-help intervention), the individual has been abstinent from alcohol 
during a period lasting between 1 and 12 months.
Alcohol dependence, sustained partial remission
After a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other 
intervention (including self-help intervention), there is a significant reduction in alcohol 
consumption for more than 12 months, such that even though intermittent or continuing 
drinking has occurred during this period, the definitional requirements for dependence have not 
been met.
Alcohol dependence, sustained full remission
After a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other 
intervention (including self-intervention), the person has been abstinent from alcohol for 12 
months or longer.

Course specifiers for substance dependence for substances other 
than alcohol
For all psychoactive substance classes other than alcohol (see the list above and Table 6.13, p. 450), 
a specifier is used to further describe the pattern of substance use or remission in the context of 
substance dependence, using a fifth-character code. Unlike alcohol, separate codes for continuous 
and episodic current use are not provided. The x below corresponds to the fourth-character code 
indicating the substance class (1 for cannabis, 2 for synthetic cannabinoids and so on).
Substance dependence, current use
The individual exhibits current substance dependence, with episodic or continuous use of the 
substance within the past month.
Substance dependence, early full remission
After a diagnosis of substance dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other 
intervention (including self-help intervention), the individual has been abstinent from the 
substance during a period lasting between 1 and 12 months.
Substance dependence, sustained partial remission
After a diagnosis of substance dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other 
intervention (including self-help intervention), there is a significant reduction in substance use 
for more than 12 months, such that even though intermittent or continuous use has occurred 
during this period, the diagnostic requirements for dependence have not been met.
 Substance dependence, sustained full remission
After a diagnosis of substance dependence, and often following a treatment episode or other 
intervention (including self-intervention), the person has been abstinent from the substance for 
12 months or longer.

Additional clinical features for substance dependence
•	 A subjective sensation of urge or craving to use the substance often, but not always, 
accompanies the essential features of substance dependence.
•	 When present as an aspect of substance dependence, withdrawal symptoms must be 
consistent with the known withdrawal state for that substance (see Table 6.16, p. 484). 
Onset and course of withdrawal are time-limited, and are related to the type of substance 
and the dose used immediately before cessation or reduction in amount.
•	 Tolerance varies as a function of individual factors (e.g. substance use history, genetics) 
and should be differentiated from initial levels of response during intoxication, which also 
exhibit significant individual variability. Laboratory testing that reveals high levels of the 
substance in bodily fluids with no evidence of significant symptoms of intoxication may 
be suggestive of tolerance. Tolerance to the effects of substances as indicated by different 
psychophysiological responses can develop at varying rates (e.g. tolerance to respiratory 
depression caused by opioid intoxication may develop prior to tolerance to the sedating 
effects of the drug). With abstinence, tolerance effects diminish over time.
•	 Individuals with certain comorbid medical conditions (e.g. chronic liver disease) typically 
have reduced tolerance to substances.
•	 Physical or mental health consequences (beyond the essential features of substance 
dependence) typically occur in people with substance dependence, but are not required 
for the diagnosis. Similarly, functional impairment in one or several domains of life (e.g. 
work, domestic responsibilities, child-rearing) is commonly seen in people with substance 
dependence, but is not required in order to assign the diagnosis.
•	 Individuals with substance dependence have elevated rates of many other mental disorders, 
including conduct-dissocial disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, impulse 
control disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized 
anxiety disorder, mood disorders, psychotic disorders and personality disorder with 
prominent dissocial features, as well as subthreshold symptoms. The specific pattern 
of co-occurrence depends on the substance involved, and reflects common risk factors 
and common causal pathways. These are distinguished from substance-induced mental 
disorders, in which the symptoms are a result of the direct physiological effects of the 
substance on the central nervous system.
•	 A pattern of substance use that includes frequent or high dose administration occurs more 
often among certain subgroups (e.g. adolescents). In these cases, peer-group dynamics 
may contribute to the maintenance of substance use. Regardless of the social contributions 
to the behaviour, a pattern of substance use that is consistent with subgroup norms should 
not be considered as presumptive evidence of substance dependence unless all diagnostic 
requirements for the disorder are met.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance dependence 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Frequent or even daily substance use of a substance does not automatically imply a 
diagnosis of substance dependence. There must also be evidence of the essential features 
of substance dependence, such as impaired control over use, increasing precedence of use 
over other life priorities or physiological features.
•	 The presence of physiological features such as tolerance and withdrawal is sometimes 
referred to as “physiological dependence”. These features may occur, for example, in 
response to prolonged therapeutic use of certain medications, such as in patients who are 
appropriately prescribed opioid analgesics for cancer pain. By themselves, however, these 
features are not sufficient for a diagnosis of substance dependence, which also requires 
either impaired control over substance use or increasing precedence of substance use over 
other activities.
Course features
•	 The course of substance dependence varies by substance, frequency, intensity and duration 
of use. The central features of the dependence syndrome may be overshadowed by the 
harms to physical and mental health that patients with dependence often experience, and 
for which they frequently seek treatment. Numerous medical conditions can occur due to 
substance use in the course of substance dependence. These conditions tend to be specific 
for each substance, although some are shared across substances. Negative consequences 
to physical health reflect the known pharmacological effects of the relevant substance, 
the toxic effects of the substance on tissues and organs, or the route of administration 
(e.g. intravenous self-administration). Examples include alcoholic cirrhosis, infective 
endocarditis and HIV/AIDS. Medical conditions caused by substance use should be 
diagnosed separately.
Developmental presentations
•	 Substance dependence may develop more rapidly during adolescence than is usual 
during adulthood, especially when there are familial or other risk factors for substance 
dependence.
•	 Tolerance to psychoactive substances may develop rapidly in adolescents and young 
adults, and may decline equally rapidly when substance use ceases or is reduced in quantity 
or frequency.
•	 Withdrawal symptoms are well recognized in neonates born to women with substance 
dependence who have used psychoactive substances during pregnancy. However, the 
presence of a withdrawal state in a neonate should not be the sole basis for a diagnosis of 
substance dependence in the mother.
•	 Older adults often have reduced tolerance to substances.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance dependence 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Substance dependence has similar features in men and women, although the intensity of 
substance use and duration of use necessary to result in dependence may differ by sex. For 
example, alcohol dependence may occur after a lower cumulative alcohol intake in women 
compared to men because of sex-related differences in body mass and composition.
•	 Women are less likely to be involved with the legal system in relation to substance use, and 
therefore may be less likely to come to clinical attention than men. In clinical contexts, 
women may be reluctant to admit using substances due to prevailing social attitudes and 
proscriptions.
•	 In some societies it may be culturally unacceptable for women to admit to substance use. 
Specific probing may be necessary to elicit a history of substance use and dependence.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with substance intoxication
Episodic or continuous intoxication with substances is a typical feature of substance dependence, 
but is not an essential feature. Conversely, even if frequent and severe, substance intoxication 
alone is not a basis for a diagnosis of substance dependence. If all diagnostic requirements of 
both conditions are met for the same episode of care, substance dependence should be assigned 
as the primary diagnosis, with an associated diagnosis of substance intoxication (e.g. opioid 
dependence with opioid intoxication) if appropriate to the specific clinical situation (e.g. in 
emergency settings).
Boundary with harmful substance use
Substance dependence is often associated with physical and mental health consequences, such 
as those seen in harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use. In the absence of the essential 
features of substance dependence, a diagnosis of harmful substance use can be given when 
there has been demonstrable harm to the individual’s physical or mental health or the health of 
others. Harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use and substance dependence should not be 
diagnosed together.
Boundary with substance withdrawal
Depending on the substance, many individuals with substance dependence develop substance 
withdrawal upon cessation or reduction in the amount of a substance consumed. In such cases, 
both substance dependence and substance withdrawal should be diagnosed. However, substance 
withdrawal can be diagnosed in the absence of a diagnosis of substance dependence – for 
example, in response to cessation of medically appropriate treatment with opioid analgesics that 
is not accompanied by the other essential features of substance dependence. Note: substance 
withdrawal is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.13, p. 450).
Boundary with substance-induced mental disorders
The impact of repeated or continuous use of substances characteristic of substance dependence 
may include substance-induced mental disorders, in which case both substance dependence and 
the relevant substance-induced mental disorder should be diagnosed (e.g. alcohol dependence 
with alcohol-induced delirium). Note: specific substance-induced mental disorders are only 
applicable for some substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).

attributable to the pharmacological effects of each substance class.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Severity of intoxication specifier
Depending on the specific clinical situation and the information available, substance 
intoxication may be classified according to the level of severity as mild, moderate or severe. 
The level of intoxication is usually related to the dose, route of administration, half-life and 
duration of action of the substance. Severity of intoxication is also affected by individual 
variability (e.g. differences in body weight, substance metabolism, tolerance). Susceptibility to 
substance intoxication may also be greater in individuals with comorbid medical conditions 
affecting drug pharmacokinetics (e.g. renal or hepatic insufficiency).
For some substances, there are specific tests for detecting and determining the concentration 
of substances in bodily fluids (e.g. blood, urine), which can be important tools for clinical 
management. However, severity of intoxication should be determined on the basis of clinical 
assessment, as specified below, and not solely based on the presence and level of the substance 
in bodily fluids.
The level of medical attention that may be required in response to substance intoxication 
varies according to the severity of intoxication and the substance involved, and varies from 
precautionary observation to urgent intervention to prevent death or permanent harm (e.g. 
administration of antagonist treatment, intubation).
Severity of intoxication can be rated as mild (XS5W), moderate (XS0T) or severe (XS25), 
using extension codes, in addition to the appropriate substance intoxication category.
To indicate severity, the code for the appropriate severity level is appended to the substance 
intoxication diagnostic code using an ampersand (&). For example, “6C43.3&XS25” is the 
code for opioid intoxication, severe.
Box 6.1. Examples of medical conditions that may present 
with symptoms similar to substance intoxication
•	 Head injury (with or without cerebral contusion or intracranial 
haemorrhage or haematoma)
•	 Meningitis and encephalitis
•	 Diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia
•	 Hepatic or other metabolic encephalopathy
•	 Wernicke’s encephalopathy
•	 Electrolyte disturbance
•	 Hypoxia or hypercapnia
•	 Systemic infection
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Mild substance intoxication
Mild substance intoxication is a state in which there are clinically recognizable disturbances in 
psychophysiological functions and responses (e.g. motor coordination, attention and judgement) 
that vary by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475), but there is little or no disturbance in the level 
of consciousness.
Moderate substance intoxication
Moderate substance intoxication is a state in which there are marked disturbances in 
psychophysiological functions and responses (e.g. motor coordination, attention and judgement) 
that vary by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475), with substantial impairment on tasks that require 
these functions. There is some disturbance in level of consciousness.
Severe substance intoxication
Severe substance intoxication is a state in which there are obvious disturbances in 
psychophysiological functions and responses (e.g. motor coordination, attention and judgement) 
that vary by substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475), with marked disturbance in level of consciousness. 
There is severe impairment to the extent that the person may not be capable of self-care or self-
protection, and may be unable to communicate or cooperate with assessment and intervention.
Note: extension codes are attached to the category to which they apply using an ampersand (&). 
For example, 6C40.3&XS0T is the code for alcohol intoxication, moderate and 6C41.3&XS5W is 
the code for cannabis intoxication, mild.
Additional clinical features for substance intoxication
•	 Psychoactive substances, whether of the same or a different pharmacological class, may 
interact such that they exacerbate or modify the features of intoxication. In cases of multiple 
psychoactive substance use in which more than one specific substance can be identified as 
a cause of the intoxication, it is recommended that the corresponding specific substance 
intoxication categories for each relevant substance should be assigned (e.g. 6C40.3 Alcohol 
intoxication and 6C41.3 Cannabis intoxication) rather than 6C4F.3 Intoxication due to 
multiple specified psychoactive substances.
•	 Substance intoxication may occur in the presence of medical conditions that cause 
impairment of levels of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour or 
coordination, which should be diagnosed separately. Determination of the etiology of 
the disturbances in psychophysiological functions or responses may require longitudinal 
assessment.
•	 A diagnosis of intoxication due to unknown or unspecified psychoactive substances can 
be assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown to the clinician. As more 
information becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant) 
the diagnosis should be changed to indicate the substance responsible for intoxication.

XS25

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Measurement of the presence or concentration of a substance in breath, blood, saliva, urine 
or other body fluids may be an important tool in the clinical management of substance 
intoxication. However, detection of a psychoactive substance in body fluids does not 
constitute a presumptive diagnosis of substance intoxication.
Course features
•	 The onset of substance intoxication varies according to the route of administration, the 
absorption of the substance and other pharmacokinetic factors. Generally, inhalation 
(smoking) and intravenous injecting routes lead to more rapid onset of intoxication, 
although oral ingestion may also lead to intoxication within minutes, depending on the 
substance.
•	 Substance intoxication is a transient condition, with the duration of intoxication 
depending on multiple factors, including the dose of the substance taken, the half-life and 
duration of action of the particular substance, and the formulation of the substance taken 
(e.g. for pharmaceutical preparations, whether a controlled-release drug has been taken). 
Intoxication may last from a few minutes to several days following the episode of use. The 
intensity of intoxication lessens with time after reaching a peak of absorption, and the 
effects eventually disappear in the absence of further use of the substance.
Developmental presentations
•	 Naive users – including adolescents – can show features of intoxication at lower levels of 
use, reflecting lower physical and learned tolerance.
•	 Older adults may have a lower tolerance than younger people to the effects of alcohol and 
other substances.
Culture-related features
•	 The degree and characteristics of intoxication displayed for a given amount of the substance 
vary considerably with circumstances, with beliefs and expectations about the effects of 
the substance, and with the cultural acceptability of displaying these effects. These factors 
result in cultural differences in the extent and manifestations of intoxication.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
•	 There are also genetic differences in susceptibility to intoxication associated with certain 
ethnic groups. Cultural and ethnically linked genetic factors have been better documented 
for alcohol than for other substances.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The amount of substance and duration of use necessary to cause intoxication differs by sex, 
reflecting differences in body weight and composition.
•	 Behaviour while intoxicated may vary by gender, reflecting not only physiological 
differences but also cultural differences and role expectations.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and harmful pattern 
of psychoactive substance use
In episode of harmful psychoactive substance use and harmful pattern of psychoactive substance 
use, consumption or administration of a substance results in damage to the person’s physical or 
mental health (including a substance-induced mental disorder) or in behaviour leading to harm to 
the health of others. Recovery from substance intoxication is generally complete. Complications 
due to such effects of intoxication such as injury, the effects of hypoxia, the effects of prolonged 
hyperactivity or inactivity, or other tissue damage should be diagnosed as episode of harmful 
psychoactive substance use or harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, as appropriate. If 
relevant at the time of the clinical encounter (e.g. in emergency settings), substance intoxication 
can be given as an associated diagnosis, with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use or 
harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use as the primary diagnosis.
Boundary with substance dependence
Episodic or continuous intoxication with a substance or substances is a typical feature of substance 
dependence. If all diagnostic requirements of both conditions are met for the same episode of care, 
substance dependence should be assigned as the primary diagnosis, with an associated diagnosis 
of substance intoxication (e.g. opioid dependence with opioid intoxication).
Boundary with substance withdrawal
Substance withdrawal occurs upon cessation or reduction of a substance in the context of 
physiological dependence or when a substance has been taken for a prolonged period or in 
large amounts. In contrast, the onset of substance intoxication occurs immediately or shortly 
after the consumption of a substance. Moreover, for a particular substance, the intoxication and 
withdrawal syndromes are typically quite distinct. See Table 6.15 (p. 475) for a description of the 
substance-specific features of substance intoxication and Table 6.16 (p. 484) for a description of 
the substance-specific features of substance withdrawal.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with substance-induced delirium
Delirium is characterized by disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness that develop 
within a short period of time, with symptoms that are transient and may fluctuate depending 
on the underlying etiology. Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, and 
may include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle 
may also be present. Delirium can be caused by intoxication or withdrawal from substances. 
When symptoms of delirium are attributable to substance intoxication, an associated diagnosis 
of substance-induced delirium should be assigned in addition to the diagnosis of substance 
intoxication. Note: substance-induced delirium is only applicable for some substances or 
substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).
Boundary with other substance-induced mental disorders
Mental or behavioural symptoms that arise during substance intoxication should only be used 
as a basis for diagnosing a substance-induced mental disorder if the intensity or duration of the 
symptoms is substantially in excess of those that are characteristic of substance intoxication due 
to the specified substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475), and the symptoms are sufficiently severe to 
warrant specific clinical attention.
Boundary with other medical conditions
A variety of medical conditions may produce symptoms that are similar to those of substance 
intoxication (see Box 6.1 for examples). Some of these medical conditions are life-threatening, 
and require immediate intervention. Evidence of substance use (e.g. positive laboratory results) 
does not rule out the possibility of a comorbid medical condition. These alternative diagnoses 
must be considered in assessing substance intoxication. Certain medical conditions may also 
augment or prolong the duration of intoxication. Symptoms of intoxication that persist after 
they can no longer be reasonably attributed to the pharmacological effects of the substance may 
suggest the presence of another medical condition. If it is determined that substance intoxication 
is comorbid with a medical condition, both diagnoses should be assigned.
Boundary with overdose
When consumption or administration of psychoactive substances results in symptoms of overdose 
(e.g. coma, life-threatening cardiac or respiratory suppression), it is typically more appropriate to 
apply a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects of substances in Chapter 22 on injury, 
poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes rather than substance intoxication.
Table 6.15 sets out the disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour 
or coordination that are most characteristic of intoxication with each class of psychoactive 
substances in the grouping of disorders due to substance use. These features are caused by the 
known pharmacological effects of the substance. Their intensity is closely related to the amount of 
the substance consumed, as well as the route of administration, interaction of the substance with 
other substances – including medications – and the duration of action of the substance. They are 
time-limited, and abate as the substance is cleared from the body.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Table 6.15. Common substance-specific features of substance 
intoxication
Substance
Common substance-specific features
Alcohol 
Presenting features of alcohol intoxication may include impaired attention, 
inappropriate or aggressive behaviour, lability of mood and emotions, impaired 
judgement, poor coordination, unsteady gait, and slurred speech. At more severe 
levels of intoxication, stupor or coma may occur.
Additional features
• Alcohol intoxication may be associated with impaired social interaction.
• Impaired coordination and judgement due to alcohol intoxication, even at low 
doses, may be sufficiently severe to affect the faculties necessary to operate 
motorized vehicles safely: alcohol intoxication is an important risk factor for road 
accidents.
• The disinhibiting effects of alcohol are associated with an increased risk of 
attempted and completed suicides.
• Higher blood levels of alcohol (e.g. >150 mg/dL) are associated with stupor and 
coma. Blood levels of alcohol above 250 mg/dL can cause respiratory depression, 
cardiac arrhythmias and death.
• Stupor and coma are more likely to occur in individuals with low tolerance or 
comorbid medical conditions.
• The more severe the intoxication, the greater the likelihood of subsequent 
amnesia for events that took place during the period of intoxication (“blackouts”).
• Some symptoms of intoxication with other substances (e.g. sedatives, hypnotics 
or anxiolytics; opioids) may be similar to those of alcohol intoxication. Evidence of 
alcohol use (e.g. the smell of alcohol on the breath) does not rule out concomitant 
intoxication with other substances.
Cannabis or synthetic 
cannabinoids
Presenting features of cannabis intoxication or synthetic cannabinoid intoxication 
may include inappropriate euphoria, impaired attention, impaired judgement, 
perceptual alterations (such as the sensation of floating, altered perception of 
time), changes in sociability, increased appetite, anxiety, intensification of ordinary 
experiences, impaired short-term memory and sluggishness. Physical signs include 
conjunctival injection (red or bloodshot eyes), dry mouth and tachycardia.
Additional features
• The principal psychoactive cannabinoid is cannabis is THC. Disturbances in 
consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour or coordination typical of 
cannabis intoxication are primarily attributable to levels of THC, although various 
other cannabinoids are also present in cannabis preparations (e.g. dried leaves 
and buds, hashish, cannabis oil).
• Synthetic cannabinoid intoxication may cause delirium or acute psychosis.
• Regular intoxication with high potency cannabis or synthetic cannabinoids may be 
associated with increased long-term risk of psychosis.
Note: medicinal cannabinoids such as cannabidiol and cannabinol – for example, 
those used as antispasmodics, anxiolytics or analgesics – typically have no or 
minimal intoxicating effects. However, standard laboratory testing for cannabinoids 
may not be able to differentiate among these different types of cannabinoids.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance intoxication 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Substance
Common substance-specific features
Opioids 
Presenting features of opioid intoxication may include somnolence, stupor, mood 
changes (e.g. euphoria followed by apathy and dysphoria), psychomotor retardation, 
impaired judgement, respiratory depression, slurred speech, and impairment of 
memory and attention. In severe intoxication, coma may ensue. A characteristic 
physical sign is pupillary constriction, but this sign may be absent when intoxication 
is due to synthetic opioids.
Additional features
• Severe opioid intoxication can lead to death due to excessive respiratory 
depression. Overdose is more likely to occur with higher-potency opioids (e.g. 
fentanyl), when the person has reduced tolerance (e.g. after detoxification) 
or when an individual who has developed tolerance uses the opioid in a novel 
environment.
• Opioid intoxication shares certain features with alcohol intoxication and sedative, 
hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication. Evidence of alcohol use (e.g. the smell of 
alcohol on the breath) does not rule out co-occurring opioid intoxication.
• Where available, laboratory testing for substances that may be contributing to 
the intoxication or their metabolites may be necessary to identify the intoxicating 
substance.
• Administration of an opioid antagonist (e.g. naloxone) may be used empirically in 
some settings (e.g. emergency settings) to differentiate opioid intoxication from 
intoxication with other substances.
Sedatives, hypnotics or 
anxiolytics
Presenting features of sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication may include 
somnolence, impaired judgement, inappropriate behaviour (including sexual 
behaviour or aggression), slurred speech, impaired motor coordination, unsteady 
gait, mood changes, and impaired memory, attention and concentration. Nystagmus 
(repetitive, uncontrolled eye movements) is a common physical sign. In severe cases, 
stupor or coma may occur.
Additional features
• Impaired memory in sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication is characterized 
by anterograde amnesia for the period of intoxication.
• Sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics are commonly prescribed medications. They 
can cause intoxication even in therapeutic doses in older individuals and in those 
with medical comorbidities.
• Some features of sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication may be similar 
to those of opioid intoxication or alcohol intoxication. Evidence of alcohol use 
(e.g. the smell of alcohol on the breath) does not rule out concomitant sedative, 
hypnotic or anxiolytic intoxication.
• Where available, laboratory testing for substances that may be contributing to 
the intoxication or their metabolites may be necessary to identify the intoxicating 
substance.
Cocaine
Presenting features of cocaine intoxication may include inappropriate euphoria, 
anxiety, anger, impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid 
ideation (sometimes of delusional intensity), auditory hallucinations, confusion and 
changes in sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and palpitations and 
chest pain may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated 
blood pressure and pupillary dilatation.
Additional features
• In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – cocaine use can result in 
seizures, muscle weakness, dyskinesia and dystonia, and myocardial infarction 
arising from coronary artery spasm or stroke arising from cerebral artery spasm.

be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, 
pupillary dilatation, dyskinesia and dystonia, and skin sores.
Additional features
• In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – use of stimulants, including 
amfetamines, methamfetamine and methcathinone, can result in seizures.
Synthetic cathinones 
Presenting features of synthetic cathinone intoxication may include anxiety, anger, 
impaired attention, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, paranoid ideation 
(possibly of delusional intensity), transient auditory hallucinations, transient 
confusion and changes in sociability. Perspiration or chills, nausea or vomiting, and 
palpitations may be experienced. Physical signs may include tachycardia, elevated 
blood pressure, pupillary dilatation, dyskinesia and dystonia, and skin sores.
Additional features
• In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – use of synthetic cathinones can 
result in seizures.
Caffeine 
Presenting features of caffeine intoxication may include restlessness, anxiety, 
excitement, 
insomnia, 
flushed 
face, 
tachycardia, 
diuresis, 
gastrointestinal 
disturbances, muscle twitching, psychomotor agitation, perspiration or chills, and 
nausea or vomiting. Cardiac arrythmias may occur. Disturbances typical of caffeine 
intoxication tend to occur at relatively high doses (e.g. >1 g per day).
Additional features
• Caffeine and related alkaloids (e.g. theobromine in tea) are present in a variety 
of foods (e.g. chocolate, kola nuts), beverages (e.g. sodas, guarana) and 
supplements (e.g. tablets, vitamins) that are consumed regularly and pervasively.
• Very high doses of caffeine (e.g. >5 g) can result in respiratory distress or seizures, 
and can be fatal.
Hallucinogens 
Presenting features of hallucinogen intoxication may include hallucinations, illusions, 
perceptual changes such as depersonalization, derealization, synaesthesias 
(blending of senses, such as a visual stimulus evoking a smell), anxiety, depressed 
or dysphoric mood, ideas of reference, paranoid ideation, impaired judgement, 
palpitations, sweating, blurred vision, tremors and lack of coordination. Physical 
signs may include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure and pupillary dilatation.
Additional features
• In rare instances, hallucinogen intoxication may increase suicidal behaviour.

Substance
Common substance-specific features
Nicotine 
Presenting features of nicotine intoxication may include restlessness, psychomotor 
agitation, anxiety, cold sweats, headache, insomnia, palpitations, paraesthesias, 
nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, confusion, bizarre dreams, burning 
sensations in the mouth and salivation.
Additional features
• Nicotine intoxication occurs more commonly in people who have recently started 
smoking or using other forms of nicotine (e.g. electronic cigarettes or “vaping”), 
and have therefore not developed tolerance. It may also occur in people who 
receive nicotine therapeutically and take it in higher than recommended doses.
• In rare instances, paranoid ideation, perceptual disturbances, convulsions or 
coma may occur.
Volatile inhalants 
Presenting features of volatile inhalant intoxication may include euphoria, impaired 
judgement, aggression, somnolence, stupor or coma, dizziness, tremor, lack of 
coordination, slurred speech, unsteady gait, lethargy and apathy, psychomotor 
retardation and visual disturbance. Muscle weakness and diplopia may occur.
Additional features
• Intentional or unintentional exposure to a variety of volatile inhalant substances 
(e.g. glue, petrol, butane, paint) can cause the symptoms of volatile inhalant 
intoxication.
• Intentional volatile inhalant intoxication typically involves “sniffing” or “huffing” the 
substances from closed containers, a practice that may lead to hypoxia, hypoxic 
brain damage and other long-lasting neurological sequelae.
• Use of volatile inhalants may cause cardiac arrythmias, cardiac arrest and death.
• Inhalants containing lead (e.g. some forms of petrol/gasoline) may cause 
confusion, irritability, coma and seizures.
• Use of volatile inhalants is more common among adolescents and young adults 
due to the greater ease of access compared to other psychoactive substances.
MDMA or related drugs, 
including MDA
Presenting features of MDMA or related drug intoxication may include increased 
or inappropriate sexual interest and activity, anxiety, restlessness, agitation and 
sweating.
Additional features
• In rare instances – usually in severe intoxication – use of MDMA or related drugs, 
including MDA, can result in dystonia and seizures. Sudden death is a rare but 
recognized complication.
Dissociative drugs, 
including ketamine and 
PCP
Presenting features of dissociative drug intoxication may include aggression, 
impulsivity, unpredictable behaviour, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, impaired 
judgement, numbness or diminished responsiveness to pain, slurred speech 
and dystonia. Physical signs include nystagmus (repetitive, uncontrolled eye 
movements), tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, numbness, ataxia, dysarthria 
and muscle rigidity.
Additional features
• In rare instances, use of dissociative drugs, including ketamine and PCP, can 
result in seizures.
• Laboratory tests to quantify PCP levels are only weakly correlated with 
disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour or 
coordination.

Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by a clinically significant cluster of symptoms, 
behaviours and/or physiological features that occurs upon cessation or reduction 
in the use of a substance in individuals who have developed dependence on that 
substance, or have used the substance for a prolonged period or in large amounts. 
Note: substance withdrawal can occur when prescribed psychoactive medications (e.g. 
opioids, anxiolytics, stimulants) have been used in standard therapeutic doses.
•	 The specific features of substance withdrawal depend on the pharmacological properties of 
the specified substance (see Table 6.16, p. 484), and are consistent with those recognized as 
occurring upon cessation or reduction of the particular substance or other members of the 
same pharmacological group of substances. The symptoms also vary in degree of severity 
and duration, depending on the substance and the amount and pattern of prior use.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another medical condition or another 
mental disorder.
Note: substance withdrawal is only applicable for some substances or substance classes (see the list 
above and Table 6.13, p. 450). Table 6.16 (p. 484) lists the most common symptoms, behaviours 
and physiological features for each substance class.

Specifiers for clinical presentation of substance withdrawal
Because of clinically important variation in their withdrawal syndromes, the following specifiers 
can be applied to alcohol withdrawal (6C40.4) and sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics withdrawal 
(6C44.4), as well as the withdrawal syndrome for other specified (6C4E.4), multiple (6C4F.4) and 
unspecified (6C4G.4) psychoactive substance categories. The x below corresponds to the fourth-
character code indicating the substance class (0 for alcohol, 1 for cannabis and so on).
Substance withdrawal, uncomplicated
All diagnostic requirements for substance withdrawal are met, and the withdrawal state is not 
accompanied by perceptual disturbances or seizures.
Substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances
All diagnostic requirements for substance withdrawal are met, and the withdrawal state is 
accompanied by perceptual disturbances (e.g. visual or tactile hallucinations or illusions) with 
intact reality testing. There is no evidence of confusion, and other diagnostic requirements for 
delirium are not met. The withdrawal state is not accompanied by seizures.
Substance withdrawal, with seizures
All diagnostic requirements for substance withdrawal are met, and the withdrawal state is 
accompanied by seizures (i.e. generalized tonic-clonic seizures) but not by perceptual disturbances.
Substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances and seizures
All diagnostic requirements for substance withdrawal are met, and the withdrawal state is 
accompanied by both seizures (i.e. generalized tonic-clonic seizures) and perceptual disturbances 
(e.g. visual or tactile hallucinations or illusions) with intact reality testing. Diagnostic requirements 
for delirium are not met.

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Additional clinical features for substance withdrawal
•	 For some substances, characteristic features of substance withdrawal are opposite to the acute 
pharmacological effects of that substance (see Table 6.15, p. 475, and Table 6.16, p. 484).
•	 Substance withdrawal symptoms become more severe with repeated episodes of withdrawal 
(termed “kindling”), with ageing, or in the presence of comorbid medical conditions.
•	 A diagnosis of substance withdrawal due to unknown or unspecified psychoactive 
substances can be assigned if the substance consumed is initially unknown. As more 
information becomes available (e.g. laboratory results, report from a collateral informant) 
the diagnosis should be changed to indicate the substance responsible for the withdrawal 
symptoms.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Substance withdrawal should only be diagnosed when symptoms are consistent with those 
recognized as occurring upon cessation or reduction in use of the particular substance or 
pharmacologically related group of substances (see Table 6.16, p. 484). Recent cessation 
or reduction of use and the presence of various nonspecific transient symptoms is not 
sufficient to make the diagnosis of substance withdrawal.
•	 Withdrawal symptoms should be differentiated from the transient physiological aftereffects 
of intoxication (“hangover effect”). For example, if low mood and reduction in energy 
are reported following use of alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics; stimulants; or 
MDMA or related drugs, and other characteristic features of substance withdrawal are 
not present, a diagnosis of substance withdrawal should not be assigned. The presence of 
a set of associated symptoms specific to different classes of psychoactive substances (see 
Table 6.16, p. 484) – as well as the frequency, amount and duration of its use and presence 
of substance dependence – should be considered in distinguishing substance withdrawal 
from a “hangover effect”.
•	 Some individuals who have previously had substance dependence may experience 
symptoms similar to those of substance withdrawal months after the last use of the 
substance, particularly when the individual encounters stimuli (e.g. drug paraphernalia) 
and contexts (e.g. location where use was frequent) previously associated with past 
substance use. These symptoms are more transient than those observed during substance 
withdrawal, and occur exclusively when in contact with associated stimuli and contexts. 
A diagnosis of substance withdrawal should not be assigned under these circumstances.
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance withdrawal 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Course features
•	 Substance withdrawal is time-limited. Factors that influence the features and time course of 
substance withdrawal include the severity of substance dependence (if present); the dose, 
frequency of use and duration of use of the substance prior to cessation or reduction of 
that use; the half-life and duration of action of the substance; and the presence of comorbid 
medical conditions (e.g. metabolic disturbances).
Culture-related features
•	 Symptoms of withdrawal depend largely on the psychotropic characteristics of the 
substance. 
•	 However, specific cultures may emphasize certain symptoms of withdrawal over others, 
making it more difficult to conduct a differential diagnosis. In addition, vernacular terms 
for withdrawal vary greatly.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with substance dependence
Depending on the substance, many individuals with substance dependence develop substance 
withdrawal upon cessation or reduction in the amount of the substance. In such cases, both 
substance dependence and substance withdrawal should be diagnosed. However, substance 
withdrawal can be diagnosed in the absence of a diagnosis of substance dependence – for 
example, in response to cessation of medically appropriate treatment with opioid analgesics that 
is not accompanied by the other essential features of substance dependence.
Boundary with substance intoxication
The onset of substance intoxication occurs immediately or shortly after the consumption of a 
substance. In contrast, substance withdrawal occurs upon cessation or reduction in the amount 
of a substance in the context of substance dependence, or when a substance has been taken for a 
prolonged period or in large amounts. For a particular substance, the intoxication and withdrawal 
syndromes are typically distinct. See Table 6.15 (p. 475) for a description of the substance-specific 
features of substance intoxication and Table 6.16 (p. 484) for a description of the substance-
specific features of substance withdrawal.
Boundary with substance-induced delirium
Delirium is characterized by disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness that develop 
within a short period of time, with symptoms that are transient and may fluctuate depending 
Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance withdrawal 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
on the underlying etiology. Delirium often includes disturbance of behaviour and emotion, and 
may include impairment in multiple cognitive domains. Disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle may 
also be present. Delirium may occur as an aspect of substance withdrawal, particularly during 
later stages of withdrawal. In such cases, diagnoses of both substance withdrawal and substance-
induced delirium should be assigned. Note: substance-induced delirium is only applicable for 
some substances or substance classes (see Table 6.14, p. 454).
Boundary with other substance-induced mental disorders
Mental or behavioural symptoms that arise during substance withdrawal should only be used 
as a basis for diagnosing a substance-induced mental disorder if the intensity or duration of the 
symptoms is substantially in excess of those that are characteristic of the substance withdrawal 
due to the specified substance (see Table 6.16, p. 484), and the symptoms are sufficiently severe to 
warrant specific clinical attention. In such cases, if the withdrawal syndrome is ongoing, diagnoses 
of both substance withdrawal and a substance-induced mental disorder may be assigned.
Boundary with other mental disorders
Various symptoms associated with substance withdrawal overlap with those that are characteristic 
of other mental disorders (e.g. depressive and anxiety symptoms). Symptoms of substance 
withdrawal occur in specific temporal relationship to the cessation of use of a specific substance, 
and diminish with the passage of time. Evidence supporting a mental disorder diagnosis would 
include the symptoms preceding the onset of the substance use, the symptoms persisting for 
a substantial period of time after cessation of the substance or medication use or withdrawal 
(e.g. 1 month or more, depending on the substance), or other evidence of a pre-existing mental 
disorder (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with substance use).
Boundary with other medical conditions
It may be difficult to distinguish between various symptoms associated with substance withdrawal 
(e.g. nausea, retching or vomiting, seizures, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, perspiration, postural 
hypotension, decreased or increased heart rate, cough, sleep disruption) and those that are 
characteristic of other medical conditions. Symptoms of substance withdrawal occur in specific 
temporal relationship to the cessation of use of a specific substance and diminish with the passage 
of time.
Boundary with fetus or newborn affected by maternal use of tobacco, alcohol, or 
other drugs of addiction
Chapter 19 on certain conditions arising during the perinatal period contains a category of fetus 
or newborn affected by maternal use of tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. A neonate exhibiting 
signs of substance withdrawal related to a specific substance may also be assigned the appropriate 
substance withdrawal diagnosis in order to guide treatment together with appropriate diagnosis 
from Chapter 19.
Substance withdrawal is a cluster of symptoms, behaviours and physiological features, varying in 
degree of severity and duration, that occur upon cessation or reduction of use of a psychoactive 
substance in individuals who have developed dependence on that substance, or who have taken 
the substance for a prolonged period or in large amounts. The diagnosis of substance withdrawal 
is applicable only to certain substances and substance groups (see Table 6.13, p. 450). Specific 
presenting features that may occur as a part of substance withdrawal for each applicable class of 
psychoactive substances in the grouping of disorders due to substance use are listed in Table 6.16.

withdrawal
Substance
Substance-specific features of withdrawal
Alcohol 
Presenting features of alcohol withdrawal may include autonomic hyperactivity 
(e.g. tachycardia, hypertension, perspiration), increased hand tremor, nausea, retching 
or vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, depressed or dysphoric mood, 
transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations, and distractibility. 
Less commonly, alcohol withdrawal is complicated by seizures.
Additional features
• Onset of alcohol withdrawal typically occurs within 6–12 hours after last use, as 
blood alcohol concentrations decline. Symptoms vary in type, severity, onset and 
duration, according to the duration and intensity of alcohol use prior to cessation 
or reduction of use.
• Features of mild or moderate withdrawal typically last for 3–7 days after cessation 
of alcohol use, and include autonomic hyperactivity, increased hand tremor, anxiety, 
insomnia, nausea, vomiting and headache. Features of moderate withdrawal 
may also include transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations, 
distractibility and psychomotor agitation.
• In 1–3% of cases, alcohol withdrawal is complicated by seizures of a tonic-clonic type. 
When seizures occur, they are usually single seizures with onset within 6–48 hours 
after last use. Evidence of a premorbid seizure disorder, other intracranial pathology 
or co-occurring use of other substances does not preclude a presumptive alcohol 
withdrawal diagnosis.
• Approximately 2% of cases of alcohol withdrawal progress to a very severe syndrome 
sometimes referred to as “delirium tremens” (or DTs), characterized by confusion 
and disorientation, delusions and prolonged visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations. 
When delirium is present, a separate diagnosis of 6C40.5 Alcohol-induced delirium 
should also be assigned. The presence of seizures during withdrawal represents a 
risk factor for development of delirium. If unrecognized or untreated, delirium during 
alcohol withdrawal is associated with substantially increased mortality compared to 
alcohol withdrawal without co-occurring delirium.
• Some symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal – such as autonomic 
hyperactivity, anxiety and insomnia – can recur or persist for several months after 
abstinence, particularly when the person is exposed to alcohol-associated cues 
(a conditioned withdrawal state). The presence of such persisting symptoms is not 
sufficient to meet diagnostic requirements for alcohol withdrawal.
Cannabis 
Presenting features of cannabis withdrawal may include irritability, anger or aggressive 
behaviour, shakiness, insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, depressed or dysphoric mood, 
decreased appetite and weight loss, headache, sweating or chills, abdominal cramps 
and muscle aches.
Additional features
• The occurrence, severity and duration of cannabis withdrawal vary according to the 
type and potency of the cannabis preparation, as well as the amount, frequency and 
duration of use before cessation or reduction of use.
• Onset of cannabis withdrawal typically occurs at some point between 12 hours and 
3 days after cessation or reduction of use. Symptom severity typically peaks at 
4–7 days and may last for 1–3 weeks after cessation of use. However, cannabis 
withdrawal may also be briefer, in some cases lasting only a few days.
• When cannabis withdrawal occurs in the context of a co-occurring mental disorder, 
the features of the other disorder (e.g. fluctuation of mood) may be exacerbated.

Substance
Substance-specific features of withdrawal
Synthetic 
cannabinoids
Presenting features of synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal may include irritability, 
anger, aggression, shakiness, insomnia and disturbing dreams, restlessness, anxiety, 
depressed or dysphoric mood and appetite disturbance. In the early phase, synthetic 
cannabinoid withdrawal may be accompanied by residual features of intoxication from 
the drug, such as paranoid ideation and auditory and visual hallucinations.
Additional features
• The occurrence, severity and duration of synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal vary 
according to the type and potency of the synthetic cannabinoid used, as well as the 
amount, frequency and duration of use before cessation or reduction of use.
• Synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal typically lasts for 1–3 weeks after cessation 
of use.
Opioids 
Presenting features of opioid withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, 
craving for an opioid, anxiety, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, muscle aches, 
yawning, perspiration, hot and cold flushes, hypersomnia (typically in the initial phase) 
or insomnia, diarrhoea, piloerection and pupillary dilation.
Additional features
• The severity and time course of opioid withdrawal is influenced by many factors 
that include the type of opioid taken, its half-life and duration of action, the amount, 
frequency and duration of opioid use before cessation or reduction of use, prior 
experience of opioid withdrawal, and expectations of the severity of the syndrome.
• Opioid withdrawal from short-acting opioids such as injected heroin or morphine 
typically begins within 4–12 hours of cessation of use and lasts for 4–10 days.
• Opioid withdrawal from longer-acting opioids such as codeine, oxycodone and 
similar pharmaceutical agents may not be evident for 2–4 days and may last for 
1–2 weeks.
• The withdrawal state from long-acting drugs such as methadone may persist for up 
to 2 months after cessation of use.
• Opioid withdrawal occurs in phases. The early phase typically includes lacrimation, 
rhinorrhoea and yawning. This is followed by hot and cold flashes, muscle aching and 
abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea; piloerection and pupillary 
dilatation may also occur. The later phase is dominated by craving for opioids.
• Recurrence or worsening of pain may occur if the opioid was used to manage 
chronic pain.
• Serious medical complications of opioid withdrawal are rare. Fluid depletion may 
occasionally lead to renal impairment. Death during opioid withdrawal is very 
uncommon.

Substance
Substance-specific features of withdrawal
Sedatives, hypnotics 
or anxiolytics
Presenting features of sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal may include anxiety, 
psychomotor agitation, insomnia, increased hand tremor, nausea or vomiting, and 
transient visual, tactile or auditory illusions or hallucinations. There may be signs of 
autonomic hyperactivity (e.g. tachycardia, hypertension, perspiration) or postural 
hypotension. The withdrawal state may be complicated by seizures.
Additional features
• The severity and time course of sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal is 
related to the particular substance taken, its half-life and duration of action, and the 
amount, frequency and duration of use before cessation or reduction of use.
• The withdrawal state associated with short-acting drugs typically has its onset 
within 12–24 hours after cessation of use and has a course of up to 14 days. 
Withdrawal onset may be delayed by 3–5 days with longer-acting drugs and may 
persist for several weeks.
• Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal may be complicated by seizures, which 
are of a tonic-clonic type and may be single or multiple.
• Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal, especially when untreated, may progress 
to a very severe form of delirium, characterized by confusion and disorientation, 
delusions, and more prolonged visual, tactile or auditory hallucinations. In such 
cases, a separate diagnosis of 6C44.5 Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic-induced 
delirium should also be assigned.
• Medical sequelae of complicated withdrawal include status epilepticus, respiratory 
compromise and renal failure.
• Some features of sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal – such as anxiety, 
transient illusions or hallucinations, and derealization – may persist for several 
months after cessation of use.
Cocaine
Presenting features of cocaine withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, 
irritability, fatigue, psychomotor agitation or retardation, vivid unpleasant dreams, 
insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, anxiety and craving for cocaine.
Additional features
• Initial symptoms of cocaine withdrawal include a dysphoric and low energy 
state manifested in depressed or dysphoric mood, irritability, fatigue, inertia and 
hypersomnia. This typically occurs within 6–24 hours of cessation of cocaine use.
• The withdrawal state may last up to 7 days. Craving for cocaine is prominent in the 
later stages.
• Suicidal ideation may occur, especially when dysphoric mood is marked.
• At the onset of cocaine withdrawal there may be features that persist from the 
intoxicating effects of cocaine, such as hyperactivity, paranoid ideation and 
auditory hallucinations.
Stimulants, including 
amfetamines, 
methamfetamine and 
methcathinone
Presenting features of stimulant withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, 
irritability, fatigue, insomnia or (more commonly) hypersomnia, vivid and unpleasant 
dreams, increased appetite, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and craving for 
amfetamine and related stimulants.
Additional features
• Stimulant withdrawal typically occurs within 24 hours to 4 days of cessation of 
stimulant use, and is characterized by a dysphoric and low energy state manifested 
in depressed or dysphoric mood, irritability, fatigue, inertia and hypersomnia.
• The severity and duration of the withdrawal state is widely variable based on the 
type of stimulant taken and the amount, frequency and duration of such use prior 
to its cessation.
• In the first phase of stimulant withdrawal, which typically lasts for 7–14 days, low 
mood, lethargy and hypersomnia predominate. After this phase, irritability and 
craving for stimulants are prominent and may persist for 6–8 weeks.
• At the onset of stimulant withdrawal there may be features that persist from the 
intoxicating effects of the stimulant, such as hyperactivity, paranoid ideation and 
auditory hallucinations.

Substance-specific features of withdrawal
Synthetic cathinones 
Presenting features of synthetic cathinone withdrawal may include depressed or 
dysphoric mood, irritability, fatigue, insomnia or (more commonly) hypersomnia, vivid 
and unpleasant dreams, increased appetite, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and 
craving for stimulants, including synthetic cathinones.
Caffeine 
Presenting features of caffeine withdrawal may include headache, marked fatigue 
or drowsiness, irritability, depressed or dysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, and 
difficulty concentrating.
Additional features:
• The severity and duration of caffeine withdrawal is related to the amount, frequency 
and duration of caffeine use prior to cessation of use.
• Onset of caffeine withdrawal is typically 12–48 hours after the last use and may last 
up to 7 days.
Nicotine 
Presenting features of nicotine withdrawal may include depressed or dysphoric mood, 
insomnia, irritability, anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, bradycardia, 
increased appetite, and craving for tobacco or other nicotine-containing products. 
Other physical symptoms may include increased cough and mouth ulceration.
Additional features:
• The severity and duration of nicotine withdrawal is variable, related to the amount, 
frequency and duration of tobacco smoked (or otherwise consumed) or of nicotine 
products taken prior to cessation of use.
• Onset of nicotine withdrawal is typically 6–24 hours after cessation or reduction of 
use. Psychological and physiological features typically last up to 10 days. Physical 
features such as increased cough and mouth ulceration may persist for 2–3 weeks.
• Craving for tobacco (or other nicotine-containing products) is prominent throughout 
the duration of nicotine withdrawal.
Volatile inhalants 
Presenting features of volatile inhalant withdrawal may include insomnia, anxiety, 
irritability, depressed or dysphoric mood, shakiness, perspiration, nausea and transient 
illusions.
Additional features:
• The severity and duration of volatile inhalant withdrawal is related to the type of 
inhalant used and to the amount, frequency and duration of use of the specific 
inhalant.
• Volatile inhalant withdrawal may be accompanied by persisting features 
of volatile inhalant intoxication or its medical 
complications, such as 
encephalopathy – especially when the inhalant used is lead-containing petrol/gasoline.
MDMA or related 
drugs, including MDA
Presenting features of MDMA or related drug withdrawal may include fatigue, lethargy, 
hypersomnia or insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, irritability, craving, difficulty in 
concentrating and appetite disturbance.
Additional features
• The above information primarily concerns withdrawal from MDMA. There is 
insufficient information on the features and course of the withdrawal state from 
drugs related to MDMA, including MDA, to fully characterize the associated 
withdrawal states.
• MDMA withdrawal is uncommon, reflecting the comparative rarity of MDMA 
dependence.
• Onset of MDMA withdrawal typically occurs within 12–24 hours after last use, 
as blood concentrations decline. The features vary in type, severity, onset and 
duration according to the amount, frequency and duration of MDMA use prior to 
cessation of use.
• The duration of MDMA withdrawal may be up to 10 days. Craving for MDMA may be 
prominent during the later stages.

Diagnostic requirements for disorders due to substance use | Substance withdrawal 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Substance-induced mental disorders
Substance-induced mental disorders are characterized by psychological, cognitive or behavioural 
symptoms that develop during or soon after psychoactive substance intoxication or withdrawal, 
or use or discontinuation of a psychoactive medication. The duration or severity of the symptoms 
is substantially in excess of the characteristic syndrome of substance intoxication or substance 
withdrawal due to the specified substance.
Substance-induced mental disorders include:
Substance-induced delirium
Substance-induced psychotic disorder
•	 with hallucinations
•	 with delusions
•	 with mixed psychotic symptoms
Substance-induced mood disorder
•	 with depressive symptoms
•	 with manic symptoms
•	 with mixed depressive and manic symptoms
Substance-induced anxiety disorder
Substance-induced obsessive-compulsive or related disorder
Substance-induced impulse control disorder.
Specific types of substance-induced mental disorders are only applicable for some substance 
classes, which are listed along with corresponding codes in the sections on specific substance-
induced mental disorders below, as well as in Table 6.14 (p. 454). Specific substance-induced mental 
disorders may characteristically have their onset during or soon after substance intoxication and/
or substance withdrawal for specific substances or substance classes.
When making a diagnosis of substance-induced mental disorder, an additional diagnosis 
indicating the related pattern of substance use should also be assigned. These include episode of 
harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use and substance 
dependence. A diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal may also be assigned 
if applicable.
Additional categories of substance-induced disorders are included in other groupings of this 
chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, and CDDR are provided in the 
corresponding sections. These categories are cross-listed in this section for reference, and include:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by psychotic symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations 
or disorganized thinking or behaviour) that develop during or soon after intoxication 
with or withdrawal from a specified substance, or use or discontinuation of a psychoactive 
medication.
•	 The intensity or duration of the psychotic symptoms is substantially in excess of psychotic-
like disturbances of perception, cognition or behaviour that are characteristic of intoxication 
or withdrawal due to the specified substance.
•	 The specified substance, as well as the amount and duration of its use, is known to be 
capable of producing psychotic symptoms (see the list above and Table 6.14, p. 454).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder such as schizophrenia 
or a mood disorder with psychotic symptoms. Evidence supporting a diagnosis of 
another mental disorder would include psychotic symptoms preceding the onset of the 
substance use, the symptoms persisting for a substantial period of time after cessation of 
the substance, or medication use or withdrawal (e.g. 1 month or more depending on the 
specific substance), or other evidence of a pre-existing mental disorder with psychotic 
symptoms (e.g. a history of prior episodes not associated with substance use).
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Specifiers for substance-induced psychotic symptoms
An additional specifier can be added to denote the presence of hallucinations, delusions, or 
mixed psychotic symptoms for alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (6C40.6), cocaine-induced 
psychotic disorder (6C45.6), stimulant-induced psychotic disorder, including amfetamines, 
methamfetamine or methcathinone (6C46.6), and synthetic cathinone-induced psychotic 
disorder (6C47.6). The x below corresponds to the fourth-character code indicating the substance 
class (0 for alcohol, 1 for cannabis and so on) (see the list above and Table 6.14, p. 454).

6C4F.73	
Impulse control disorder induced by multiple specified psychoactive 
substances
6C4G.73	
Impulse control disorder induced by unknown or unspecified psychoactive

Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by persistently repeated behaviours in which there is 
recurrent failure to resist an impulse, drive or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to 
the person – at least in the short term – despite longer-term harm either to the individual or 
to others (e.g. fire setting or stealing without apparent motive, repetitive sexual behaviour, 
aggressive outbursts), or by behaviours similar to those seen in disorders due to addictive 
behaviours (i.e. excessive gambling or gaming).
•	 The disturbance in impulse control develops during or soon after intoxication with or 
withdrawal from a specified substance, or use or discontinuation of a psychoactive 
medication.
•	 The intensity or duration of the disturbance in impulse control is substantially in excess of 
impulse control disturbances that are characteristic of intoxication or withdrawal due to 
the specified substance.
•	 The specified substance, as well as the amount and duration of its use, is known to be capable 
of producing disturbances in impulse control (see the list above and Table 6.14,  p. 454). 
•	 The symptoms and behaviours are not better accounted for by another mental disorder 
such as an impulse control disorder or a disorder due to addictive behaviours. Evidence 
supporting a diagnosis of another mental disorder would include an impulse control 
disturbance preceding the onset of the substance use, the disturbance persisting for a 
substantial period of time after cessation of the substance or medication use or withdrawal 
(e.g. 1 month or more depending on the specific substance), or other evidence of a pre-

existing mental disorder with impulse control disturbance (e.g. a history of prior episodes 
not associated with substance use).
•	 The symptoms and behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort.
Additional clinical features for substance-induced mental disorders
•	 Substance-induced mental disorders may present with varying patterns of symptoms, 
depending on the specific substance used as well as characteristics of the user (e.g. genetics, 
metabolism, personality factors). Substance use in higher amounts or over longer periods 
of time is more likely to be associated with the development of a substance-induced 
mental disorder.
•	 Symptoms of substance-induced mental disorder usually resolve or improve after sustained 
cessation of substance use. Longer-lasting and in some cases permanent changes can 
occur in amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances, including medications, and in 
dementia due to psychoactive substances, including medications. Perceptual disturbances 
that last for weeks, months or years (e.g. trails of images of moving objects, geometric 
illusions) can also occur as a result of hallucinogen use – primarily LSD – and are referred 
to as “posthallucinogen perception disorder” or “hallucinogen-induced persisting 
perception disorder”.
•	 The duration of substance withdrawal for some substances can be protracted. For 
substances with more protracted withdrawal periods, the onset of symptoms of substance-
induced mental disorder can occur up to several weeks after the cessation of substance use. 
Substance-induced mental disorder symptoms related to substances with more protracted 
withdrawal periods may also last for correspondingly longer periods of time.
•	 In cases in which multiple psychoactive substances are used, it is often challenging to 
distinguish which substance is the cause of the substance-induced mental disorder. When 
the specific etiological substance cannot be determined, a diagnosis of substance-induced 
mental disorder due to multiple specified psychoactive substances, including medications, 
may assigned. In cases of multiple psychoactive substance use in which more than one 
specific substance can be identified as a cause of the substance-induced mental disorder, 
the corresponding specific substance-induced mental disorder diagnoses should be 
given instead.
Boundary with normality (threshold) for substance-induced 
mental disorders
•	 Symptoms of substance-induced mental disorders should be differentiated from known 
side-effects of psychoactive medication that are not significantly impairing or distressing, 
and from transient physiological aftereffects of intoxication (“hangover effects”). The 
duration or severity of the symptoms in substance-induced mental disorders must be 
Substance-induced impulse control disorders

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
in excess of side-effects (e.g. transient jitteriness as a side-effect of methylphenidate) or 
hangover effects (e.g. transient low mood following alcohol use) of the specified substance, 
and result in significant distress or impairment of functioning.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential 
diagnosis) for substance-induced mental disorders
Boundary with substance intoxication and substance withdrawal
Mental or behavioural symptoms that occur during substance intoxication or substance 
withdrawal should only be used as a basis for diagnosing a substance-induced mental disorder if 
the intensity or duration of the symptoms is substantially in excess of those that are characteristic 
of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal due to the specified substance (see Table 6.16, 
p. 484), and the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant specific clinical attention.
Boundary with episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of 
psychoactive substance use or substance dependence
The impact of repeated or continuous use of substances characteristic of harmful pattern of 
substance use and substance dependence may include substance-induced mental disorders. 
Substance-induced mental disorders can also be associated with a single episode of substance use. 
In such cases, a substance-induced mental disorder should be diagnosed together with a primary 
diagnosis of episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive 
substance use or substance dependence.
Boundary with mental disorders not induced by substances
Substance-induced mental disorders are differentiated from mental disorders with similar 
features that are not induced by substances on the basis of their onset, course and clinical features. 
A diagnosis of substance-induced mental disorder requires evidence from history, physical or 
mental examination, or laboratory findings of recent substance use, intoxication or withdrawal. 
Most substance-induced mental disorders resolve or improve within several weeks of cessation of 
substance use. Mental disorders not induced by substances may precede the onset of substance use 
or may continue to be symptomatic during periods of sustained abstinence. The co-occurrence 
of substance use or withdrawal and onset of symptoms of mental disorders should not be taken 
as evidence for a presumptive diagnosis of a substance-induced mental disorder. Some people 
use substances to suppress symptoms of mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and other primary 
psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, personality disorders), 
and full symptomatic presentations only emerge upon cessation or reduction in substance use. 
Furthermore, substance use can exacerbate symptoms or precipitate an episode of a pre-existing 
mental disorder. Finally, substance use may be associated with – but not etiological for – new 
onset of symptoms of a mental disorder. Although a diagnosis of a substance-induced mental 
disorder should not be assigned under these circumstances, an additional diagnosis of episode of 
harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use or substance 
dependence may still be appropriate.

consequences of non-psychoactive substance use. Non-psychoactive substances include laxatives, 
growth hormone, erythropoietin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. They may also 
include proprietary or over-the-counter medicines and folk remedies.
Disorders due to use of non-psychoactive substances do not include disorders related 
to psychoactive substances such as anabolic steroids, antidepressants, medications with 
anticholinergic properties (e.g. benztropine), and some antihistamines. These should be classified 
under 6C4E Disorders due to use of other specified psychoactive substance, including medications.
Episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances
Essential (required) features
•	 An episode of use of a non-psychoactive substance that has caused clinically significant 
damage to a person’s physical health or mental health is required for diagnosis.
•	 Harm to the health of the individual occurs due to the direct or secondary toxic effects 
of the non-psychoactive substance on body organs and systems, or a harmful route of

•	 The harm to health is not better accounted for by a medical condition not caused by the 
substance or by another mental disorder.

Substance-induced mental disorders | Disorders due to use of non-psychoactive substances
6C4H.0

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Note: harm to physical health includes acute health problems resulting from non-psychoactive 
substance use such as dehydration or dyslipidemia, and exacerbation or decompensation of 
pre-existing chronic health problems such as hypertension, liver disease or peptic ulceration. 
Harm may also result from a harmful route of administration (e.g. non-sterile intravenous self-
administration causing infections). Harm to mental health refers to psychological and behavioural 
symptoms following non-psychoactive substance use (e.g. severe depressive symptoms following 
dehydration and mineral loss from inappropriate use of laxatives).
Additional clinical features
•	 There must be explicit evidence of harm to the individual’s physical or mental health. 
There must also be a clear causal relationship between the harm to health and the episode 
of non-psychoactive substance use in question.
•	 Non-psychoactive substance use may occur in the context of other mental disorders (e.g. 
use of laxatives in anorexia nervosa to reduce body weight, use of anabolic steroids in 
body dysmorphic disorder to increase muscle mass). An additional diagnosis of episode 
of harmful psychoactive substance use can be made if the specific episode of non-
psychoactive substance use in question has resulted in clinically significant harm to the 
individual’s physical or mental health.
•	 A diagnosis of episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances often signals 
an opportunity for intervention, including lower-intensity interventions that can be 
implemented in a wide range of settings aimed at reducing the likelihood of additional 
harmful episodes, or of progression to harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use.
•	 As more information becomes available indicating that an episode is part of a continuous 
or recurrent pattern of harmful non-psychoactive substance use, a diagnosis of episode 
of harmful psychoactive substance use should be changed to harmful pattern of non-
psychoactive substance use.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The diagnosis of episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances requires clinically 
significant harm to the individual’s physical or mental health. Examples of impact on 
physical or mental health that would not be considered clinically significant include mild 
hangover, brief episodes of vomiting or transient depressed mood.
•	 An episode of non-psychoactive substance use may also cause social problems that do not 
constitute clinically significant harm to physical or mental health (e.g. arguments with 
loved ones). A diagnosis of episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances should 
not be assigned in these circumstances.

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with other specified hazardous drug use
The category other specified hazardous drug use from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health 
status or contact with health services may be assigned if the episode of non-psychoactive substance 
use in question appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences 
to an extent that warrants attention and advice from health professionals, but has not resulted in 
specific identifiable harm to the individual’s physical or mental health.
Boundary with harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use
If the harm to health is a result of a known episodic or continuous pattern of non-psychoactive 
substance use, harmful pattern of non-psychoactive substance use is the appropriate diagnosis 
rather than episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances. Substance use is generally 
considered to be following a pattern if there has been at least episodic or intermittent use over 
a period of at least 12 months, or continuous use over at least 1 month. If harm is caused by 
use of a non-psychoactive substance but no information is available about the pattern or history 
of substance use, a diagnosis of episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive substances may be 
assigned until such time as evidence for a pattern of use is ascertained.
Boundary with injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes
When use of a non-psychoactive substance results in injury or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. 
coma, severe cardiac, respiratory symptoms), a diagnosis from the grouping of harmful effects of 
substances in Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes 
should also be assigned.
Harmful pattern of use of non-psychoactive substances
Essential (required) features
•	 A pattern of repeated or continuous use of a non-psychoactive substance that has caused 
clinically significant damage to a person’s physical health or mental health is required for 
diagnosis.
•	 Harm to the health of the individual occurs due to the direct or secondary toxic effects 
of the non-psychoactive substance on body organs and systems, or a harmful route of 
administration.
•	 The pattern of use of the relevant substance is evident over a period of at least 12 months if 
substance use is episodic or at least 1 month if use is continuous.
•	 The harm to health is not better accounted for by a medical condition not caused by the 
substance or by another mental disorder.
Note: harm to physical health includes acute or chronic health problems resulting from a pattern 
of non-psychoactive substance use such as testicular atrophy, cardiomegaly, and exacerbation

Course specifiers
Harmful pattern of use of non-psychoactive substances, episodic
This category is assigned when all the diagnostic requirements for harmful pattern of use of 
non-psychoactive substances are met, and there is evidence of a pattern of recurrent episodic or 
intermittent use of the relevant non-psychoactive substance over a period of at least 12 months 
that has caused clinically significant harm to a person’s physical or mental health.
Harmful pattern of use of non-psychoactive substances, continuous
This category is assigned when all the diagnostic requirements for harmful pattern of use of non-
psychoactive substances are met, and there is evidence of a pattern of continuous substance use 
(daily or almost daily) of the relevant non-psychoactive substance over a period of at least 1 
month that has caused clinically significant harm to a person’s physical or mental health.
Harmful pattern of use of non-psychoactive substances, unspecified
Additional clinical features for harmful pattern of use of non-

Boundary with episode of harmful non-psychoactive substance use
If the harm to health is a result of a single episode of non-psychoactive substance use rather than 
an episodic or continuous pattern of substance use, episode of harmful use of non-psychoactive 
substances is the appropriate diagnosis rather than harmful pattern of non-psychoactive 
substance use. Substance use is generally considered to be following a pattern if there has been 
at least episodic or intermittent use over a period of at least 12 months, or continuous use over 
at least 1 month. If harm is caused by use of a non-psychoactive substance but no information is

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Secondary-parented categories in disorders due to substance use 
Hazardous substance use
ICD-11 also includes a listing of hazardous substance use categories. These are not considered 
to be mental disorders but rather are included in the grouping “Problems associated with health 
behaviours” in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services. 
Available categories for hazardous substance use due to specific substance classes are as follows.
Hazardous substance use categories may be used when the pattern of substance use appreciably 
increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences, to the user or to others, to 
an extent that warrants attention and advice from health professionals, but no overt harm has yet 
occurred.
In hazardous substance use, the increased risk may be related to the frequency of substance use, 
to the amount used on a given occasion, or to risky behaviours associated with substance use 
or the context of use, from a harmful route of administration, or from a combination of these. 
The risk may be related to short-term effects of the substance or to longer-term cumulative effects 
on physical or mental health or functioning. Hazardous substance use has not yet reached the 
level of having caused harm to physical or mental health of the user or others around the user. 
The pattern of substance use often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the 
user or to others.

Disorders due to addictive behaviours include the following:

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Gambling disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A persistent pattern of gambling behaviour – which may be predominantly online (i.e. 
over the internet or similar electronic networks) or offline – is required for diagnosis, 
manifested in all of the following:
•	 impaired control over gambling behaviour (e.g. onset, frequency, intensity, duration, 
termination, context);
•	 increasing priority given to gambling behaviour to the extent that gambling takes 
precedence over other life interests and daily activities;
•	 continuation or escalation of gambling behaviour despite negative consequences (e.g. 
marital conflict due to gambling behaviour, repeated and substantial financial losses, 
negative impact on health).
•	 The pattern of gambling behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent, but is 
manifested over an extended period of time (e.g. 12 months).
•	 The gambling behaviour is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a 
manic episode) and is not due to the effects of a substance or medication.
•	 The pattern of gambling behaviour results in significant distress or impairment in personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Specifiers for online or offline behaviour
Note: the order of specifiers is different than for 6C51 Gaming disorder.
Gambling disorder, predominantly offline
•	 This refers to gambling disorder that predominantly involves gambling behaviour that is 
not conducted over the internet or similar electronic networks (i.e. offline).
Gambling disorder, predominantly online
•	 This refers to gambling disorder that predominantly involves gambling behaviour that is 
conducted over the internet or similar electronic networks (i.e. online).

Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gambling disorder 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 If symptoms and consequences of gambling behaviour are severe (e.g. gambling behaviours 
persist for days at a time without respite, or have major effects on functioning or health) 
and all other diagnostic requirements are met, it may be appropriate to assign a diagnosis 
of gambling disorder following a period that is briefer than 12 months (e.g. 6 months).
•	 Individuals with gambling disorder may make numerous unsuccessful efforts to control 
or significantly reduce gambling behaviour, whether self-initiated or imposed by others.
•	 Individuals with gambling disorder may increase the amount of money gambled over time 
to maintain or exceed previous levels of excitement, or to avoid boredom. They may also 
engage in a pattern of increasing intensity of gambling behaviour, increasing the amount of 
their wagers, or otherwise altering their gambling strategies in order to try to compensate 
for significant monetary loses (“chasing” their losses).
•	 Individuals with gambling disorder often experience urges or cravings to engage in 
gambling behaviour during other activities.
•	 Individuals with gambling disorder may exhibit substantial disruptions in diet, sleep, 
exercise and other health-related behaviours that can result in negative physical and 
mental health outcomes.
•	 Some individuals with gambling disorder may engage in deceitful behaviour to conceal 
the extent of their losses from loved ones, or attempt to obtain money in order to repay 
their debts.
•	 Some individuals with gambling disorder may engage in gambling behaviour in response 
to feelings of depression, anxiety, boredom, loneliness or other negative affective states. 
Although not diagnostically determinative, consideration of the relationship between 
emotional and behavioural cues and gambling behaviour can inform treatment planning.
•	 Gambling disorder commonly co-occurs with disorders due to substance use, mood 
disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and personality disorder. Among individuals 
seeking treatment for gambling disorder, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are 
common.
•	 In adults, gambling behaviour is associated with chronic medical conditions, obesity and 
poorer subjective health status.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Gambling disorder should not be diagnosed merely on the basis of repeated or persistent 
gambling (online or offline), such as in the context of social or professional gambling. 
Typically, these forms of gambling are limited to discrete periods, with monetary losses 
that are acceptable to the individual, and occur in the absence of the other characteristic 
features of the disorder.
•	 Daily gambling behaviour (e.g. buying lottery tickets) as a part of a routine or the use 
of gambling for purposes such as changing mood, alleviating boredom or facilitating 
social interaction in the absence of the other required features is not a sufficient basis for 
assigning a diagnosis of gambling disorder.
Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gambling disorder 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Course features
•	 The course of gambling disorder is variable, with recovery a common outcome even in the 
absence of intervention, especially for adolescents and young adults. However, for many, 
gambling disorder persists across the lifespan.
•	 Gambling behaviour can follow a continuous or episodic pattern. The intensity of gambling 
behaviour often fluctuates in relation to stress, depressive symptoms and substance use.
•	 Gambling disorder tends to develop gradually over the course of years, as frequency of 
gambling behaviour and monetary value of wagers increase.
Developmental presentations
•	 Gambling disorder typically has its onset in adolescence or young adulthood. Early onset 
is associated with higher levels of impulsivity. Prevalence of gambling disorder among 
adolescents tends to be higher than among adults.
•	 Onset of gambling disorder in older adulthood is uncommon.
Culture-related features
•	 Prevalence of gambling disorder varies by sociocultural background. For example, 
community-based prevalence in the United States is lower among immigrants than among 
United States-born individuals. Indigenous populations in several counties (e.g. Canada, 
New Zealand and the United States) appear to have higher prevalence than other ethnic 
groups, possibly due to greater financial hardship, the hope that gambling may help 
advance social goals, and the location of casinos on tribal lands.
•	 Endorsement of specific symptoms of gambling disorder may also vary cross-culturally. For 
example, among individuals with gambling problems in the United States, Asian Americans 
may be less likely to describe being preoccupied with gambling, while Latin Americans 
and African Americans may be more likely to describe attempts to reduce gambling.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Lifetime prevalence of gambling disorder is higher among males. In adulthood, the ratio of 
men to women diagnosed with gambling disorder is approximately 2:1. This gap is wider 
during adolescence (ratio of 4:1), which may reflect boys’ tendency to start gambling earlier.
Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gambling disorder 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Due to earlier onset, the course of gambling disorder is typically more protracted among 
men. Men also appear more likely to recover without intervention than women. Although 
onset among women tends to be later, symptoms often intensify more quickly. Women are 
more likely to seek treatment sooner than men, though treatment-seeking is low (less than 
10%) across both genders.
•	 Women with gambling disorder are more likely to have co-occurring mood disorders or 
anxiety and fear-related disorders, whereas men are more likely to exhibit problems with 
substance abuse and externalizing behaviours.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hazardous gambling or betting
The category of hazardous gambling or betting from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health 
status or contact with health services may be assigned to individuals who exhibit problematic 
patterns of gambling without the other features of gambling disorder. Hazardous gambling or 
betting refers to a pattern of gambling that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical 
or mental health consequences, to the individual or to others around the individual, that may 
require intervention or monitoring but is not considered a disorder.
Boundary with gaming disorder
Unlike gambling disorder, gaming disorder does not involve the betting of money or other 
valuables with the hope of obtaining something of greater value. If gaming behaviour is focused 
on wagers (e.g. internet poker), gambling disorder is generally the more appropriate diagnosis.
Boundary with bipolar and related disorders
Increased goal-directed activity – including impaired ability to control gambling behaviour – can 
occur during manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes. A diagnosis of gambling disorder should 
only be assigned if there is evidence of a persistent pattern of gambling behaviour that meets all 
diagnostic requirements for the disorder, and occurs outside of mood episodes. Some individuals 
with gambling disorder may exhibit symptoms while gambling that appear similar to those 
observed during manic episodes (e.g. euphoric mood and increased energy level). However, in 
mood episodes, such symptoms are not limited to the gambling context.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Gambling behaviour can sometimes be described as “compulsive” by lay people and also by some 
health professionals. Compulsions observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almost never 
experienced as inherently pleasurable; they typically occur in response to intrusive, unwanted 
and generally anxiety-provoking obsessions, which is not the case with gambling behaviour in 
gambling disorder.
Boundary with personality disorder
Some individuals with personality disorder with prominent dissocial features or prominent 
features of disinhibition may engage in problematic gambling behaviour. A diagnosis of gambling 
disorder can be assigned together with a personality disorder diagnosis if the diagnostic 
requirements for both are met.
Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gambling disorder 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Co-occurrence of gambling and substance use – particularly alcohol – is common. Intoxication 
due to some substances, including alcohol, can cause disinhibition and impaired judgement, 
which may exacerbate problematic gambling behaviour. A diagnosis of gambling disorder can 
be assigned together with a disorder due to substance use diagnosis if the requirements for both 
are met.
Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications
Use of specific prescribed medications or illicit substances (e.g. dopamine agonists such as 
pramipexole for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome or illicit substances such as 
methamfetamine) can sometimes cause impaired control over gambling behaviour due to their 
direct effects on the central nervous system, with onset corresponding to use of the substance or 
medication. Gambling disorder should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Gaming disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A persistent pattern of gaming behaviour (“digital gaming” or “video gaming”) – which 
may be predominantly online (i.e. over the internet or similar electronic networks) or 
offline – is required for diagnosis, manifested in all of the following:
•	 impaired control over gaming behaviour (e.g. onset, frequency, intensity, duration, 
termination, context);
•	 increasing priority given to gaming behaviour to the extent that gaming takes precedence 
over other life interests and daily activities;
•	 continuation or escalation of gaming behaviour despite negative consequences (e.g. 
family conflict due to gaming behaviour, poor scholastic performance, negative impact 
on health).
•	 The pattern of gaming behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent, but is 
manifested over an extended period of time (e.g. 12 months).
•	 The gaming behaviour is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. a manic 
episode) and is not due to the effects of a substance or medication.
•	 The pattern of gaming behaviour results in significant distress or impairment in personal, 
family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

and all other diagnostic requirements are met, it may be appropriate to assign a diagnosis 
of gaming disorder following a period that is briefer than 12 months (e.g. 6 months).
•	 Individuals with gaming disorder may make numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or 
significantly reduce gaming behaviour, whether self-initiated or imposed by others.
•	 Individuals with gaming disorder may increase the duration or frequency of gaming 
behaviour over time, or experience a need to engage in games of increasing levels of 
complexity or requiring increasing skills or strategy in an effort to maintain or exceed 
previous levels of excitement, or to avoid boredom.
•	 Individuals with gaming disorder often experience urges or cravings to engage in gaming 
during other activities.
•	 Upon cessation or reduction of gaming behaviour, often imposed by others, individuals 
with gaming disorder may experience dysphoria and exhibit adversarial behaviour or 
verbal or physical aggression.
•	 Individuals with gaming disorder may exhibit substantial disruptions in diet, sleep, exercise 
and other health-related behaviours that can result in negative physical and mental health 
outcomes, particularly if there are very extended periods of gaming.
•	 High-intensity gaming behaviour may occur as a part of online computer games that 
involve coordination among multiple users to accomplish complex tasks. In these cases, 
peer-group dynamics may contribute to the maintenance of intensive gaming behaviours. 
Regardless of the social contributions to the behaviour, the diagnosis of gaming disorder 
may still be applied if all diagnostic requirements are met.
•	 Gaming disorder commonly co-occurs with disorders due to substance use, mood 
disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder and sleep-wake disorders.

Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gaming disorder 

Disorders due to substance use or addictive behaviours
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Gaming disorder should not be diagnosed merely on the basis of repeated or persistent 
gaming (online or offline) in the absence of the other characteristic features of the disorder.
•	 Daily gaming behaviour as a part of a routine or the use of gaming for purposes such 
as developing skills and proficiency in gaming, changing mood, alleviating boredom or 
facilitating social interaction in the absence of the other required features is not a sufficient 
basis for assigning a diagnosis of gaming disorder.
•	 High rates and long durations of gaming behaviour (online or offline) that occur more 
commonly among specific age and social groups (e.g. adolescent males), and in particular 
contexts such as during the holidays or as part of organized gaming activities for 
entertainment in the absence of the other required features, are also not indicative of a 
disorder. Cultural, subcultural and peer-group norms should be considered when making 
a diagnosis.
Course features
•	 The course of gaming disorder is typically progressive, as the individual increasingly 
prioritizes gaming at the expense of other activities.
•	 Individuals with both autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity exhibit 
elevated rates of problematic gaming and gaming disorder. This appears to be related 
to preferences for particular types of stimuli, and possibly also to the use of gaming to 
regulate attention.
Developmental presentations
•	 Gaming disorder appears to be most prevalent among adolescent and young adult males 
aged 12–20 years. Available data suggest that adults have lower prevalence rates.
•	 Among adolescents, gaming disorder has been associated with elevated levels of 
externalizing (e.g. antisocial behaviour, anger control) and internalizing (e.g. emotional 
distress, lower self-esteem) problems. Among adults, gaming disorder has been associated 
with greater levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms.
•	 Adolescents with gaming disorder may be at increased risk of academic underachievement, 
school failure/dropout, and psychosocial and sleep problems.
Disorders due to addictive behaviours | Gaming disorder 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Males appear to be more frequently affected by gaming disorder during both adolescence 
and adulthood.
•	 Although less frequently diagnosed with gaming disorder than adolescent boys, girls 
who meet the diagnostic requirements may be at greater risk of developing emotional or 
behavioural problems.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with hazardous gaming
The category of hazardous gaming from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact 
with health services may be assigned to individuals who exhibit problematic patterns of gaming 
behaviour without the other features of gaming disorder. Hazardous gaming refers to a pattern 
of gaming that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences, 
to the individual or to others around the individual, that may require some intervention or 
monitoring but is not considered to constitute a disorder.
Boundary with gambling disorder
Unlike gaming disorder, gambling disorder necessitates the betting of money or other valuables 
in the hope of obtaining something of greater value. If gaming behaviour is focused on wagers 
(e.g. internet poker), gambling disorder may be a more appropriate diagnosis.

Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications
Use of specific prescribed medications or illicit substances (e.g. dopamine agonists such as 
pramipexole for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome or illicit substances such as 
methamfetamine) can sometimes cause impaired control over gaming behaviour due to their 
direct effects on the central nervous system, with onset corresponding to use of the substance or 
medication. Gaming disorder should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Other specified disorder due to addictive behaviours
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by symptoms that share primary clinical features with 
other disorders due to addictive behaviours, including a persistent pattern of repetitive 
behaviour in which the individual exhibits impaired control over the behaviour (e.g. onset, 
frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context); increasing priority given to the 
behaviour to the extent that it takes precedence over other life interests and daily activities; 
and continuation or escalation of the behaviour despite negative consequences (e.g. family 
conflict, poor scholastic performance, negative impact on health). 
Note: impaired control over substance use or sexual behaviour is not included in 
this category.
•	 The pattern of repetitive behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent, but is 
manifested over an extended period of time (e.g. 12 months).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, an obsessive-compulsive 
or related disorder, a feeding or eating disorder, an impulse control disorder), are not a 
manifestation of another medical condition, and are not due to the effects of a substance 
or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

Secondary-parented categories in disorders due to addictive 
behaviours 
Hazardous gambling or betting and hazardous gaming
These categories are not considered to be mental disorders; instead, they are included in the 
grouping of problems associated with health behaviours in Chapter 24 on factors influencing 
health status or contact with health services.
Hazardous gambling or betting
Hazardous gambling or betting refers to a pattern of gambling or betting that appreciably increases 
the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the individual or to others around 
the individual. The increased risk may be from the frequency of gambling or betting, the amount 
of time spent on these activities, the context of gambling or betting, the neglect of other activities 
and priorities, risky behaviours associated with gambling or betting or its context, the adverse 
consequences of gambling or betting, or a combination of these factors. The pattern of gambling or 
betting often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the individual or to others. 
This category may be used when the pattern of gambling or betting warrants attention and advice 
from health professionals but does not meet the diagnostic requirements for gambling disorder.
Hazardous gaming
Hazardous gaming refers to a pattern of gaming, either online or offline, that appreciably increases 
the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the individual or to others around 
the individual. The increased risk may be from the frequency of gaming, the amount of time 
spent on these activities, the neglect of other activities and priorities, risky behaviours associated 
with gaming or its context, the adverse consequences of gaming, or a combination of these 
factors. The pattern of gaming often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the 
individual or to others. This category may be used when the pattern of gaming behaviour warrants 
attention and advice from health professionals but does not meet the diagnostic requirements for 
gaming disorder.

Kleptomania
Impulse control disorders
Pyromania
Impulse control disorders are characterized by the repeated failure to resist a strong impulse, 
drive or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the person – at least in the short term – despite 
longer-term harm either to the individual or to others, marked distress about the behaviour 
pattern, or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. Impulse control disorders involve a range of specific behaviours, 
including fire setting, stealing, sexual behaviour and explosive aggressive outbursts.
The episodes of the behaviour involved in impulse control disorders are often preceded by a rise 
in tension or affective arousal, which can also occur when attempting to resist the behaviour. 
The episodes of the behaviour are typically followed by pleasure, gratification or relief of tension. 
However, over the course of the disorder, individuals may report less awareness of building 
tension or arousal prior to the behaviour, or a reduction in pleasure or gratification following 
the behaviour. They may also experience feelings of guilt or shame following the behaviour. 
The behaviours involved in impulse control disorders are not fully attributable to another mental 
disorder, the direct central nervous system effects of a medication or substance – including 
substance intoxication and withdrawal – or another medical condition not classified under 
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Pyromania
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to set 
fires, resulting in multiple acts of, or attempts at, setting fire to property or other objects.
•	 There is a lack of apparent motive (e.g. monetary gain, revenge, sabotage, political 
statement, attracting recognition) for the acts of, or attempts at, fire setting.
•	 The individual exhibits persistent fascination or preoccupation with fire and related stimuli 
(e.g. watching fires, building fires, fascination with firefighting equipment).
•	 The individual experiences increased tension or affective arousal prior to instances of, or 
attempts at, fire setting.
•	 The individual experiences pleasure, excitement, relief or gratification during and 
immediately following the act of setting the fire, and while witnessing its effects or 
participating in its aftermath.
•	 Acts of, or attempts at, fire setting are not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual 
development, another mental disorder (e.g. a manic episode) or substance intoxication.
Additional clinical features
•	 The impulse to set fires in individuals with pyromania may involve a careful planning 
phase to determine how to commit the act, with a concomitant gradual increase of tension 
or affective arousal; in other instances, fire setting may occur opportunistically without 
planning. In both cases, there is a lack of control over urges or impulses to set fires.
•	 In individuals with pyromania, fire setting may occur in response to feelings of depressed 
mood, anxiety, boredom, loneliness or other negative affective states. Although not 
diagnostically determinative, consideration of the relationship between emotional 
and behavioural cues and fire-setting behaviour may be an important aspect of 
treatment planning.
•	 Many individuals with pyromania exhibit impairments in social skills and a history of 
learning difficulties. Furthermore, individuals with pyromania – particularly women – 
often report histories of exposure to trauma, including sexual abuse, and self-harm.
•	 Conduct-dissocial disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and adjustment 
disorder are frequently associated with fire setting. Furthermore, pyromania appears 
commonly to co-occur with disorders due to substance use, gambling disorder, mood 
disorders, impulse control disorders, and disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders.
6C70
Impulse control disorders | Pyromania

Impulse control disorders | Pyromania
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Intentional fire setting can occur for a variety of reasons. Individuals may set fires for 
profit or to conceal a crime, as an act of revenge, to commit sabotage or make a political 
statement, or to attract recognition (e.g. deliberately setting a fire to then be the first one 
to discover it and put it out). Moreover, interest in fires is typical during early childhood, 
and young children may accidentally or intentionally set fires as a part of developmental 
experimentation (e.g. playing with matches, lighters, fire). A diagnosis of pyromania is not 
appropriate in such cases.
Course features
•	 Although the longitudinal course is unknown, pyromania appears to be chronic if 
untreated.
•	 Among individuals with pyromania, fire-setting events tend to be episodic, to wax and 
wane over time, and progressively to become more frequent and intense.
Developmental presentations
•	 The typical age of onset has not yet been definitively established, but current evidence 
suggests that most fire-setting behaviour begins during adolescence or early adulthood.
•	 Prevalence rates of pyromania, as distinct from fire setting and arson, suggest that the 
disorder is rare, particularly among children. In contrast, interest in fires among young 
children is common, and children may set fires accidentally (e.g. playing with matches) 
or purposefully without having the additional required diagnostic features of pyromania. 
A diagnosis of pyromania is not appropriate under these circumstances. However, fire-
setting behaviour among children and adolescents is a significant problem, as nearly half 
of arson arrests are among young people below the age of 18 years. Lifetime prevalence of 
fire setting among adults is estimated at 1.13%, and is lowest among older adults.
•	 Limited information about the presentation of pyromania in adolescents is available, 
making it difficult to determine whether it is similar to the adult presentation of the 
disorder. The rising tension and relief reported among adults has not been as clearly 
documented among young people.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Pyromania and fire-setting behaviour is more common among males.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly children and adolescents – 
may set fires impulsively. However, impulsivity and disregard for consequences in attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder are typically observed across multiple contexts and situations. Furthermore, 
individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit the diagnostic features of 
preoccupation with fire, tension or affective arousal prior to fire setting, and gratification or relief 
once the act is committed that are characteristic of pyromania.
Boundary with bipolar type I disorder and schizophrenia and other primary 
psychotic disorders
Fire setting may, in rare instances, be associated with manic or mixed episodes in individuals 
with bipolar type I disorder. However, in such cases, fire-setting does not continue once the mood 
episode has ended, whereas in individuals with pyromania fire setting is not exclusively associated 
with manic or mixed episodes. Some individuals with delusions or hallucinations may set fires 
in response to command hallucinations or in the context of a delusional system, and pyromania 
should not be assigned in these cases.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Fire setting can sometimes be described as “compulsive” by lay people and also by some health 
professionals. Compulsions observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almost never 
experienced as inherently pleasurable; they typically occur in response to intrusive, unwanted 
and typically anxiety-provoking obsessions. In contrast, fire setting in pyromania is preceded by 
an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal, and is followed by an experience of pleasure, 
excitement or gratification.
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent 
dissocial features
Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent dissocial 
features may set fires as part of a more pervasive pattern of antisocial behaviour, and often for 
discernible motives such as personal gain or revenge rather than to relieve tension or affective 
arousal. Individuals with pyromania do not typically exhibit antisocial behaviour apart from their 
fire setting.
Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications
Fire setting may occur during substance intoxication. Pyromania should not be diagnosed 
if the fire setting is better accounted for by intoxication or the disinhibiting effects of alcohol, 
Impulse control disorders | Pyromania

Impulse control disorders
Impulse control disorders | Kleptomania
drugs or medication. However, among individuals with pyromania, alcohol and substance use 
may be associated with fire setting. The presence of features of pyromania outside of episodes of 
intoxication is helpful in making this distinction.
Boundary with disinhibition in dementia and secondary personality change
Some individuals with dementia or secondary personality change may set fires as a part of a more 
general pattern of disinhibition of impulse control due to brain damage. A separate diagnosis of 
pyromania should not be assigned in such cases.
Boundary with disorders associated with impairment of cognitive or intellectual 
functioning
Some individuals with dementia, disorders of intellectual development, or cognitive or intellectual 
impairment associated with other conditions may set fires due to their impaired judgement 
without exhibiting the other features of pyromania.
Kleptomania
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by a recurrent failure to control strong impulses to 
steal objects.
•	 There is a lack of apparent motive for stealing objects (e.g. objects are not acquired for 
personal use or monetary gain).
•	 The individual experiences increased tension or affective arousal prior to instances of theft 
or attempted theft.
•	 The individual experiences pleasure, excitement, relief or gratification during and 
immediately following the act of stealing.
•	 Acts of theft or attempted theft are not better accounted for by a disorder of intellectual 
development, another mental disorder (e.g. a manic episode) or substance intoxication.
Additional clinical features
•	 Some individuals with kleptomania report amnesia or experience other dissociative 
symptoms during the act of stealing, and may have difficulty remembering their affective 
state prior to and immediately after the act, including whether they experienced mounting 
tension or arousal before and gratification or relief after stealing. Furthermore, over the 
course of the disorder, individuals may report less awareness of increased tension or 
arousal prior to incidents of stealing.
•	 In individuals with kleptomania, stealing may occur in response to feelings of depressed 
mood, anxiety, boredom, loneliness or other negative affective states. Although not 
6C71

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

diagnostically determinative, consideration of the relationship between emotional and 
behavioural cues and stealing behaviour may be an important aspect of treatment planning.
•	 After stealing items, many individuals with kleptomania experience guilt or shame for 
having committed a theft, but these feelings do not prevent recurrence of the behaviour. 
Although individuals with kleptomania may desire the items they steal and have a practical 
use for such items, they do not need these items (e.g. they have multiples of the same item, 
they have more than adequate financial resources to purchase the stolen item).
•	 Rates of co-occurrence of mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, other 
impulse control disorders, substance use disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder 
among individuals with kleptomania are higher than in the general population.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Stealing behaviour is common, and most individuals who steal do so because they need 
or want something they cannot afford, as an act of mischief, or as an expression of anger 
or vengeance. The diagnosis of kleptomania requires that the individual does not need 
or could afford to buy the stolen items, but cannot resist the urge to steal. Moreover, in 
kleptomania, the theft is accompanied by a sense of tension before committing the act and 
a sense of gratification, pleasure or relief during and immediately after the act. Individuals 
who steal for monetary gain due to the financial implications of their substance use or 
gambling should not be diagnosed with kleptomania.
Course features
•	 The course of kleptomania is variable, and may take different forms: sporadic, with long 
periods of remission between brief episodes; episodic, with lengthy periods of stealing 
followed by periods of remission; or chronic, with fluctuations in intensity.
•	 Treatment-seeking individuals with kleptomania commonly report a long history of 
shoplifting (e.g. for more than 10 years) prior to seeking help.
Developmental presentations
•	 Onset of kleptomania may occur at any time, but is most common during late adolescence. 
Onset during late adulthood is rare.
Impulse control disorders | Kleptomania

Impulse control disorders
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Women are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with kleptomania.
•	 Gender differences in clinical presentation or severity of symptoms have not been observed.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder – particularly children and adolescents 
– may steal impulsively. However, impulsivity and disregard for consequences in attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder are typically observed across multiple contexts and situations. Furthermore, 
individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder do not exhibit tension or affective arousal 
prior to stealing, and gratification or relief once the theft is committed.
Boundary with bipolar type I disorder and schizophrenia and other primary 
psychotic disorders
Stealing may be associated with manic or mixed episodes in individuals with bipolar type I disorder. 
However, in such cases, stealing does not continue once the mood episode has ended, whereas 
in individuals with kleptomania stealing is not exclusively associated with mood episodes. Some 
individuals with delusions or hallucinations may steal in response to command hallucinations 
or in the context of a delusional system, and kleptomania should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Stealing in kleptomania can sometimes be described as “compulsive” by lay people and also by 
some health professionals. Compulsions observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almost 
never experienced as inherently pleasurable; they typically occur in response to intrusive, 
unwanted and typically anxiety-provoking obsessions. In contrast, stealing in kleptomania is 
preceded by an increasing sense of tension or affective arousal and is followed by an experience of 
pleasure, excitement or gratification.
Boundary with hoarding disorder
Some individuals with hoarding disorder steal objects as part of a pattern of excessive accumulation, 
and individuals with kleptomania may hoard stolen objects. However, individuals with hoarding 
disorder accumulate possessions to the extent that living spaces becoming so cluttered that their 
use or safety is compromised.
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent 
dissocial traits
Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder with prominent dissocial 
features may commit theft as part of more pervasive pattern of antisocial behaviour, and often for 
discernible motives such as personal gain or revenge rather than to relieve symptoms of tension. 
Individuals with kleptomania do not exhibit antisocial behaviour other than stealing.
Impulse control disorders | Kleptomania

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications
Episodes of stealing may occur during substance intoxication. Individuals taking prescribed 
dopamine agonists – for example, for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome – may exhibit 
repetitive stealing behaviour with onset corresponding to use of the medication. Kleptomania 
should not be diagnosed if stealing is better accounted for by intoxication or the disinhibiting 
effects of alcohol, drugs or medication. However, among individuals with kleptomania, alcohol 
and substance use may be associated with acts of theft or attempted theft. The presence of features 
of kleptomania outside of episodes of intoxication is helpful in making this distinction.
Boundary with disinhibition in dementia and secondary personality change
Some individuals with dementia or secondary personality change may steal objects as a part 
of a more general pattern of disinhibition of impulse control due to brain damage. A separate 
diagnosis of kleptomania should not be assigned in such cases.
Boundary with disorders associated with impairment of cognitive or intellectual 
functioning
Some individuals with dementia, disorders of intellectual development, or cognitive or intellectual 
impairment associated with other conditions may steal objects due to their impaired judgement 
without exhibiting the other features of kleptomania.
Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, 
repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour, manifested in 
one or more of the following.
•	 Engaging in repetitive sexual behaviour has become a central focus of the individual’s 
life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and 
responsibilities.
•	 The individual has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce 
repetitive sexual behaviour.
•	 The individual continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse 
consequences (e.g. marital conflict due to sexual behaviour, financial or legal 
consequences, negative impact on health).
•	 The individual continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when they derive 
little or no satisfaction from it.
•	 The pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges and resulting 
repetitive sexual behaviour is manifested over an extended period of time (e.g. 6 months 
or more).
•	 The pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges and resulting 
repetitive sexual behaviour is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. 
a manic episode) or other medical condition, and is not due to the effects of a substance 
or medication.
6C72
Impulse control disorders | Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder

Impulse control disorders
•	 The pattern of repetitive sexual behaviour results in marked distress or significant 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important 
areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is only through significant additional 
effort. Distress that is entirely related to moral judgements and disapproval about sexual 
impulses, urges or behaviours is not sufficient to meet this requirement.
Additional clinical features
•	 Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may be expressed in a variety of behaviours, 
including sexual behaviour with others, masturbation, use of pornography, cybersex 
(internet sex), telephone sex and other forms of repetitive sexual behaviour.
•	 Individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder often engage in sexual behaviour in 
response to feelings of depression, anxiety, boredom, loneliness or other negative affective 
states. Although not diagnostically determinative, consideration of the relationship 
between emotional and behavioural cues and sexual behaviour may be an important 
aspect of treatment planning.
•	 Individuals who make religious or moral judgements about their own sexual behaviour 
or view it with disapproval, or who are concerned about the judgements and disapproval 
of others or about other potential consequences of their sexual behaviour, may describe 
themselves as “sex addicts” or describe their sexual behaviour as “compulsive” or similar 
terms. In such cases, it is important to examine carefully whether such perceptions are only 
a result of internal or external judgements or potential consequences, or whether there is 
evidence that impaired control over sexual impulses, urges or behaviours and the other 
diagnostic requirements of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder are actually present.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 There is wide variation in the nature and frequency of individuals’ sexual thoughts, 
fantasies, impulses and behaviours. This diagnosis is only appropriate when the individual 
experiences intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges that are experienced as irresistible 
or uncontrollable, leading to repetitive sexual behaviour, and when the pattern of repetitive 
sexual behaviour results in marked distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Individuals with 
high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g. due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit 
impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in 
functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The 
diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and 
behaviour (e.g. masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is 
associated with distress.
•	 Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on distress related 
to moral judgements and disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that 
would otherwise not be considered to be indicative of psychopathology (e.g. a woman who 
believes that she should not have sexual impulses at all; a religious young man who believes 
Impulse control disorders | Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

that he should never masturbate; a person who is distressed about their homosexual 
attraction or behaviour). Similarly, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder cannot be 
diagnosed based solely on distress related to real or feared social disapproval of sexual 
impulses or behaviours.
•	 Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based solely on relatively 
brief periods (e.g. up to several months) of increased sexual impulses, urges and behaviours 
during transitions to contexts that involve increased availability of sexual outlets that 
previously did not exist (e.g. moving to a new city, a change in relationship status).
Course features
•	 Many individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder report a history of sexually 
acting out during pre-adolescence or adolescence (e.g. risky sexual behaviour, masturbation 
to modulate negative affect, extensive use of pornography).
Developmental presentations
•	 Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in adulthood has been associated with high rates 
of childhood traumas, including sexual abuse, with women reporting higher rates and 
severity of abuse.
•	 Adolescents and adults with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder commonly experience 
high rates of co-occurring mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, 
including disorders due to substance use.
•	 Assessing the presence of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may be particularly 
challenging during adolescence due to divergent views regarding the appropriateness 
of sexual behaviour during this life stage. Increased frequency of sexual behaviour or 
uncontrolled sexual urges associated with rapidly changing hormonal levels during 
this developmental stage may be considered to reflect normal adolescent experiences. 
Conversely, frequent or risky sexual behaviour among adolescents may be considered 
abnormal due to the potential for the behaviour to interfere with social and 
emotional development.
Culture-related features
•	 Cultural and subcultural variation may exist for compulsive sexual behaviour. Norms 
for what is considered appropriate sexual behaviour, activities judged unacceptable, and 
perceptions regarding gender roles influence sexual activity. These factors may affect norms 
regarding masturbation, use of pornography, having multiple sexual partners concurrently 
and the number of lifetime sexual partners.
Impulse control disorders | Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder

Impulse control disorders
•	 Culture shapes the distress caused by engaging in sexual behaviour and whether sexual 
activity is viewed as disordered. For example, in cultures where masculine ideals are 
associated with sexual conquest, higher rates of sexual behaviour may be considered 
normative, and should not be the primary basis for assigning a diagnosis.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Men are more likely to be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder.
•	 Women with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder are more likely than men to report a 
history of childhood sexual abuse.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with bipolar and related disorders
Increased sexual impulses, urges or behaviours and impaired ability to control them can occur 
during manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder 
should only be assigned if there is evidence of persistent failure to control intense, repetitive sexual 
impulses, urges or behaviours and the presence of all other diagnostic requirements outside of 
mood episodes.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Although the word “compulsive” is included in the name of this condition, sexual behaviour in 
compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not considered to be a true compulsion. Compulsions 
in obsessive-compulsive disorder are almost never experienced as inherently pleasurable; they 
commonly occur in response to intrusive, unwanted and typically anxiety-provoking thoughts, 
which is not the case with sexual behaviour in compulsive sexual behaviour disorder.
Boundary with personality disorder
Some individuals with personality disorder may engage in repetitive sexual behaviour as a 
maladaptive regulation strategy (e.g. to prevent or reduce emotional distress or to stabilize their 
sense of self). Although both diagnoses can be assigned together, if the sexual behaviour is 
entirely accounted for by emotion dysregulation or other core features of personality disorder, an 
additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not warranted.
Boundary with paraphilic disorders
The core feature of compulsive sexual behavioural disorder is a persistent pattern of failure to 
control intense repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour that 
results in marked distress or impairment in functioning. Paraphilic disorders, on the other hand, 
are characterized by persistent and intense patterns of atypical sexual arousal manifested in sexual 
thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours, and have resulted in actions towards individuals whose 
age or status renders them unwilling or unable to consent, or are associated with marked distress 
or significant risk of injury or death. If an individual with a paraphilic disorder is able to exercise 
Impulse control disorders | Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

some degree of control over the behavioural expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional 
diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural disorder is generally not warranted. If, however, 
the diagnostic requirements of both compulsive sexual behavioural disorder and a paraphilic 
disorder are met, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications
Use of specific prescribed medications or illicit substances (e.g. dopamine agonists such as 
pramipexole for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome or illicit substances such as 
methamfetamine) can sometimes cause impaired control over sexual impulses, urges or 
behaviours due to their direct effects on the central nervous system, with onset corresponding 
to use of the substance or medication. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be 
diagnosed in such cases.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Episodes of impulsive or disinhibited sexual behaviour may occur during substance intoxication. 
At the same time, co-occurrence of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder and substance use is 
common, and some individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder use substances with 
the intention of engaging in sexual behaviour or to enhance pleasure from it. Distinguishing 
between compulsive sexual behaviour disorder and repetitive patterns of substance use with 
associated sexual behaviour is therefore a complex clinical judgement based on an assessment of 
the sequencing, context and motivations of the relevant behaviours. A diagnosis of compulsive 
sexual behaviour disorder may be assigned together with a disorder due to substance use if the 
diagnostic requirements for both are met.
Boundary with dementia and medical conditions not classified under mental, 
behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
Some individuals with dementia, diseases of the nervous system or other medical conditions 
that have effects on the central nervous system may exhibit failure to control sexual impulses, 
urges or behaviours as a part of a more general pattern of disinhibition of impulse control due 
to neurocognitive impairment. A separate diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder 
should not be assigned in such cases.
Intermittent explosive disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by a pattern of recurrent, brief, explosive episodes 
involving verbal aggression (e.g. verbally attacking another person, temper outbursts, 
yelling) or physical aggression in an individual who is at least 6 years of age – when inhibition 
of angry outbursts is expected to have been attained – or equivalent developmental level 
is required for diagnosis. Episodes of physical aggression may result in significant damage 
or destruction of property or physical assault involving personal injury; however, such 
outcomes are not required for the diagnosis.
•	 The intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly out of proportion 
to the provocation or precipitating event or situation.
6C73
Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder

Impulse control disorders
•	 The explosive outbursts must occur regularly over an extended period of time (e.g. at least 
3 months), representing a persistent pattern of aggressive behaviour. A lower frequency 
threshold (e.g. several times over the course of a year) may be used for high-intensity 
outbursts with serious negative consequences, such as physically assaulting another person, 
whereas a higher frequency threshold (e.g. two or more times per week) should be used 
for episodes characterized by verbal aggression or non-assaultive and non-destructive 
physical aggression.
•	 The aggressive behaviours are clearly impulsive or reactive in nature, and represent a failure 
to control aggressive impulse. That is, the aggressive acts are not planned or instrumental 
in achieving a desired outcome.
•	 The frequency and intensity of explosive episodes is outside the limits of normal variation 
expected for the individual’s age and developmental level.
•	 The explosive outbursts are not better accounted for by another mental, behavioural or 
neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger, conduct-dissocial 
disorder, delirium).
•	 The explosive outbursts are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central 
nervous system (e.g. amfetamines), including substance intoxication and withdrawal, or 
due to a disease of the nervous system.
•	 The behaviour pattern results in significant distress for the individual with the disorder, 
or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning.
Additional clinical features
•	 Explosive episodes may be associated with affective symptoms (anger, irritability, 
rage) during aggressive outbursts. Sometimes the aggressive episodes are preceded by 
premonitory symptoms such as tremor or chest tightness, or a more general feeling of 
tension or arousal.
•	 Explosive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are typically triggered by perceived 
threats in social settings (even when there is no real threat but, for example, threat is 
perceived based on an inaccurate attribution of hostility to others), or by frustration when 
facing obstacles in the course of daily life.
•	 A wide array of aggressive behaviours could fulfil the requirements for intermittent 
explosive disorder, ranging from verbal aggression to physical assault and destruction 
of property.
•	 After the explosive episode, the individual often, but not always, experiences depressed 
mood or fatigue, or other negative emotions such as regret, remorse, guilt or shame.
•	 Some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder exhibit nonspecific abnormalities 
on neurological examination (e.g. “soft signs”) and in EEGs that do not constitute a 
diagnosable disease of the nervous system. In the presence of such findings, intermittent 
explosive disorder may still be diagnosed if the diagnostic requirements are met.
•	 Many individuals with intermittent explosive disorder have a history of exposure to 
traumatic events, witnessing violence, or childhood physical abuse.
•	 Intermittent explosive disorder often co-occurs with depressive disorders, anxiety and 
fear-related disorders, disorders due to substance use, and eating disorders (especially 
those involving binge eating).
Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Aggressive outbursts – particularly verbal ones – are common, especially when an 
individual is under stress, and are not in themselves indicative of psychopathology. The 
mere occurrence of one or two isolated explosive episodes is not sufficient for the diagnosis, 
regardless of the severity or consequences of the behaviour. This diagnosis should only be 
considered when the intensity of the outbursts or the degree of the aggressiveness is grossly 
out of proportion to the provocation or precipitating event or situation, and the outbursts 
occur regularly over an extended period of time, representing a persistent pattern of 
aggressive behaviour.
Course features
•	 The mean age of onset of intermittent explosive disorder is between 10 and 16 years. Age of 
onset is typically earlier than common co-occurring disorders such as depressive disorders, 
anxiety and fear-related disorders, eating disorders and disorders due to substance use.
•	 Intermittent explosive disorder tends to exhibit a persistent course over many years. 
Aggressive behaviour in general tends to diminish over time, and the prevalence of 
intermittent explosive disorder correspondingly diminishes over the lifespan.

•	 Early in the course of intermittent explosive disorder, children typically display temper 
tantrums associated with verbal outbursts and aggression against objects, although 
typically without serious destruction of objects or assault against others.
•	 During adolescence, explosive outbursts often escalate to include destruction of objects or 
property, or physical assault against others.
Culture-related features
•	 Variation in prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder may be related to cultural norms 
regarding emotion regulation. Some cultures emphasize emotional restraint, equanimity, 
interpersonal harmony and social conformity such that individuals suppress or mute overt 
expressions of hostility or anger. In other cultures, freer expressions of negative affect 
are more typical. Whether or not a verbal expression is considered aggressive should be 
evaluated within the context of what is normative within the individual’s culture.
Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder

Impulse control disorders
•	 Societies vary in the degree to which they consider anger a harmful emotion, associated 
with substantial personal and social risk. Some cultural concepts of distress are attributed 
to pent-up anger, such as ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) in Latin America and hwa-
byung (anger illness) in the Republic of Korea. It may be appropriate to apply a diagnosis of 
intermittent explosive disorder to some behavioural patterns of ataque de nervios involving 
paroxysmal violence and destruction of property.
•	 The typical level of expressed emotionality varies cross-culturally, including by gender and 
age. Cultural minorities, immigrants or individuals in post-conflict settings may be at risk 
of being mislabelled as excessively angry because of this variation. Moreover, clinicians may 
misattribute anger to a single triggering event when it is in reaction to the accumulation of 
multiple environmental stressors (e.g. discrimination, losses, displacement, limited social 
support, powerlessness, injustice). Clinicians should consider the larger social context and 
how it may be related to the expression of anger before assigning a diagnosis.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although it was originally believed that intermittent explosive disorder was much more 
prevalent among males, recent community surveys suggest similar prevalence rates by 
gender. However, serious physical assault is a more common manifestation of the disorder 
in males, whereas less serious physical and verbal aggression is more characteristic 
of females.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Explosive outbursts with aggressive behaviours may occur in some individuals with autism 
spectrum disorder. These outbursts are usually associated with a specific trigger that is related to the 
core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (e.g. a change in routine, aversive sensory stimulation, 
anxiety, rigidity when the individual’s thoughts or behaviours are interrupted). Individuals with 
intermittent explosive disorder do not exhibit other features of social communication difficulties 
and restricted or repetitive behaviours that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Intermittent explosive disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are both characterized 
by impulsive behaviour. However, intermittent explosive disorder is specifically characterized by 
intermittent severe aggressive outbursts rather than ongoing generalized behavioural impulsivity 
that may be seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Both diagnoses may be assigned if the 
full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Regularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or 
duration to the provocation may also occur in the context of oppositional defiant disorder with 
chronic irritability-anger, particularly in response to demands by authority figures. In such cases, 
Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

an additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be assigned. Individuals 
with oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other features 
of oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, which 
are not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with intermittent 
explosive disorder are more likely to exhibit significant physical aggression.
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder
People with intermittent explosive disorder may come into conflict with other people and with 
law enforcement because of their explosive outbursts, but these episodes do not constitute a 
more general pattern of antisocial behaviour characteristic of conduct-dissocial disorder (e.g. 
rule violations, lying, theft). In addition, intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by 
impulsive aggression, while aggression in conduct-dissocial disorder is often premeditated and 
instrumental.
Boundary with personality disorder
Due to interpersonal, occupational and other consequences of a recurrent pattern of verbal and 
physical aggression, some individuals with intermittent explosive disorder are likely to meet the 
diagnostic requirements for personality disorder with prominent features of disinhibition. Both 
diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met, but the utility of 
assigning an additional diagnosis of personality disorder in such cases depends on the specific 
clinical situation.
Boundary with other mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders
Aggressive outbursts may occur as a part of a number of mental disorders (e.g. disorders 
specifically associated with stress, mood disorders, schizophrenia and other primary psychotic 
disorders). In general, an additional diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be 
given when the outbursts are better accounted for by another disorder.
Boundary with the effects of psychoactive substances, including medications
Explosive aggressive behaviours may occur during substance intoxication or withdrawal. 
Intermittent explosive disorder should not be diagnosed if the outbursts are solely attributable 
to intoxication or the disinhibiting effects of alcohol, drugs or medication. However, among 
individuals with intermittent explosive disorder, alcohol and substance use are commonly 
associated with episodes of aggressive behaviour. In these situations, the distinction should be 
made based on the presence of features of intermittent explosive disorder at times other than 
during episodes of intoxication.
Boundary with malingering
Some individuals who engage in recurrent acts of verbal or physical aggression may falsely 
report additional symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder, with 
the intent of obtaining a mental disorder diagnosis to avoid criminal charges or other negative 
consequences. Intermittent explosive disorder should not be diagnosed in such cases.
Boundary with dementia and other medical conditions
The diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be assigned when the impulsive 
aggressive behaviours are entirely explained by dementia, a disease of the nervous system – 
including stroke – or another medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. a brain tumour).
Impulse control disorders | Intermittent explosive disorder

Impulse control disorders
Other specified impulse control disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by symptoms that share primary clinical features with 
other impulse control disorders; that is, persistently repeated behaviours in which there 
is failure to resist an impulse, drive or urge to perform an act that is rewarding to the 
person – at least in the short term – despite negative consequences such as longer-term 
harm either to the individual or to others.
•	 The symptoms do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements for any other disorder in the 
impulse control disorders grouping.
•	 The symptoms are not characterized by recurrent and habitual actions directed at the 
integument (e.g. skin and hair), which should be classified under body-focused repetitive 
behaviour disorders.
•	 The symptoms are not characterized by gambling, gaming or other addictive behaviours.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. dementia, a 
disorder due to addictive behaviours, an obsessive-compulsive or related disorder).
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not developmentally appropriate or culturally sanctioned.
•	 The symptoms or behaviours are not a manifestation of another medical condition, and 
are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g. 
methamfetamine or dopamine agonists such as pramipexole for Parkinson disease or 
restless legs syndrome), including substance intoxication and withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms result in significant distress or significant impairment in personal, family, 
social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
6C90
Disruptive behaviour and 
dissocial disorders
Oppositional defiant disorder
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are characterized by persistent behaviour problems 
across multiple settings, with onset commonly, but not exclusively, during childhood. When 
present, these problems often persist into adulthood. These disorders are characterized by 
behaviours that range from those described as disruptive – that is, markedly and persistently 
defiant, disobedient, provocative or spiteful – to behaviours that are considered dissocial because 
they persistently violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules 
or laws.
A majority of individuals commit isolated acts of aggression or rule violation at some point in 
their lives, and this does not warrant the diagnosis of a disruptive behaviour or dissocial disorder. 
In all cases, the behaviours characteristic of the disorders in this grouping must clearly depart 
from the normal range for the individual’s age and gender, given their sociocultural context.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders may co-occur with other mental, behavioural 
and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, a separate diagnosis of a disruptive behaviour or 
dissocial disorder is not warranted if the disruptive behaviour is limited to symptomatic episodes 
of another mental disorder (e.g. defiant and noncompliant behaviour during a depressive 
episode), or if the behaviour is due to the effects of a substance or to another medical condition.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are frequently associated with psychosocial 
environments that include family dysfunction; problems with peers, co-workers and romantic 
partners; and failure at school or work. Other psychosocial risk factors are common, such as 
peer rejection, deviant peer-group influences and parental mental disorder. Behaviours that are 
adaptive given the individual’s environmental circumstances (e.g. running away from an abusive 
home; stealing in order to survive) should not be used as the sole basis for these diagnoses.

With limited prosocial emotions
With typical prosocial emotions
Unspecified
Oppositional defiant disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A pattern of markedly noncompliant, defiant and disobedient behaviour that is atypical 
for individuals of comparable age, developmental level, gender and sociocultural context 
is required for diagnosis. The pattern of behaviour may include:
•	 persistent difficulty getting along with others (e.g. arguing with authority figures; actively 
defying or refusing to comply with requests, directives or rules; deliberately annoying 
others; blaming peers or co-workers for mistakes or misbehaviour);
•	 provocative, spiteful or vindictive behaviour (e.g. antagonizing others, using social media 
to attack or mock others);
•	 extreme irritability or anger (e.g. being touchy or easily annoyed, losing temper, angry 
outbursts, being angry and resentful).
•	 The behaviour pattern has persisted for an extended period of time (e.g. 6 months or more).
•	 The oppositional behaviours are not better accounted for by relational problems between 
the individual and a particular authority figure towards whom the individual is behaving 
in a defiant manner. Examples may include parents, teachers or supervisors who act 
antagonistically or place unreasonable demands on the individual.
•	 The behaviour pattern results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational or other important areas of functioning.

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
Specifiers for the presence or absence of chronic irritability-anger
Two specifiers indicating the presence or absence of chronic irritability-anger can be assigned 
to the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.
Oppositional defiant disorder, with chronic irritability-anger
•	 All diagnostic requirements for oppositional defiant disorder are met.
•	 The presentation is characterized by prevailing, persistent irritable mood or anger that is 
atypical for individuals of comparable age, developmental level, gender and sociocultural 
context, including most of the following features:
•	 often feeling angry or resentful, showing bitterness towards others, or feeling as if things 
are unfair;
•	 often being touchy or easily annoyed, exhibiting oversensitivity or irritation to minimal 
or perceived provocations;
•	 often losing temper, exhibiting angry verbal or behavioural outbursts – which may include 
tantrums, destructive behaviours or other forms of severe mood dysregulation.
•	 The anger or resentment, touchiness or annoyance, and loss of temper is out of proportion 
in intensity or duration to any provocation, and may be present independent of any 
apparent provocation.
•	 Chronic irritability-anger is characteristic of the individual’s functioning nearly every day, 
are not limited to discrete periods, is observable across multiple settings or domains of 
functioning (e.g. home, school, social relationships), and is not restricted to the individual’s 
relationship with their parents or guardians.
•	 The pattern of chronic irritability-anger is not better accounted for by another mental 
disorder (e.g. irritable mood in the context of manic or depressive episodes).
•	 Individuals with this subtype usually also display other characteristic features of 
oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours.
Oppositional defiant disorder, without chronic irritability-anger
•	 All diagnostic requirements for oppositional defiant disorder are met.
•	 The presentation is characterized by absence of prevailing, persistently angry or irritable 
mood. In these individuals, anger and irritability occur less frequently, and tend to be 
transitory, less severe and less often out of proportion to the provocation compared to 
individuals with chronic irritability-anger.

6C90.Z
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Although often identified through parental report of noncompliant behaviour, the negative 
and antagonistic aspects of oppositional defiant disorder also exert a broader negative 
influence on interactions with others outside the family. Oppositional defiant disorder is 
associated with peer rejection and interpersonal discord through the school years and into 
adulthood.
•	 Frequently, the oppositional defiant features have a provocative quality, such that 
individuals initiate confrontations and may be seen as excessively rude and uncooperative.
•	 Younger children (e.g. 3–5 years of age) are typically more closely supervised, and receive 
frequent instructions and limits imposed on them by authority figures (e.g. parents or 
other guardians, caregivers, teachers). As children grow older, direct demands by authority 
figures typically become less frequent. Moreover, others interacting with children or 
adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder may come to avoid placing demands on 
them due to their negative response. Therefore, a diagnosis is not precluded because 
oppositional or defiant behaviours occur relatively infrequently, as long as they characterize 
most interactions with authority figures.
•	 Adults with oppositional defiant disorder continue to experience conflictual relationships 
with parents and family members, and have generally poorer social support networks. 
This affects the number and quality of their friendships and romantic relationships. They 
typically struggle to function in the workplace due to difficulties in their interactions with 
supervisors and co-workers.
•	 Features of irritability and anger (e.g. being touchy or easily annoyed, losing temper, 
being angry and resentful) are sometimes the predominant characteristics of the clinical 
presentation. However, irritability and anger alone are neither necessary nor sufficient 
for the diagnosis. These symptoms must be accompanied by a pattern of markedly 
noncompliant, defiant and disobedient behaviour that is atypical for individuals of 
comparable age and developmental level. The presence of chronic irritability-anger is 
indicated using the corresponding specifier.
•	 Oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger is not necessarily more 
severe or rare than oppositional defiant disorder without chronic irritability-anger. Rather, 
oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger identifies a pattern of mood 
dysregulation that can range in severity from frequent and impairing tantrums to extreme 
presentations of the mood dysregulation.
•	 Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder may present with limited prosocial 
emotions. When assessing for oppositional defiant disorder, the clinician should also assess 
for limited prosocial emotions; if present, the appropriate specifier should be assigned (see 
p. 548). Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder with limited prosocial emotions are 
more likely to exhibit a more persistent and severe pattern of antisocial behaviour that may 
subsequently meet the diagnostic requirements for conduct-dissocial disorder.
•	 Oppositional defiant disorder in childhood frequently co-occurs with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder, and internalizing disorders such as 
depressive disorders or anxiety and fear-related disorders.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Transient noncompliance, defiance and disobedience including irritability or anger can 
occur within the normal range of behaviour as a part of typical development, or in response 
to increased demands on the developing child or changes in the child’s environment 
(e.g. transition to a new school or city), or as a manifestation of normative anxiety in the 
context of specific tasks or situations (e.g. going to school and separating from parents 
for the first time). The presence of such behaviours should not be taken as evidence for 
a presumptive diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder 
should only be diagnosed when there is a persistent pattern of markedly noncompliant, 
defiant and disobedient behaviour that is atypical considering the individual’s age, gender 
and sociocultural context.
Course features
•	 The heterogeneity of presentations in oppositional defiant disorder has meaningful clinical 
and prognostic implications. Oppositional defiant disorder can be a developmental 
precursor for the development of conduct-dissocial disorder, especially when the 
presentation of oppositional defiant disorder includes severely defiant or spiteful/
vindictive behaviours. However, many children with oppositional defiant disorder do not 
subsequently develop conduct-dissocial disorder.
•	 A diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger is associated 
with the subsequent development of depressive disorders and anxiety and 
fear-related disorders.
Developmental presentations
•	 Typical age of onset of oppositional defiant disorder is in middle childhood, with initial 
symptoms typically appearing at preschool age. Symptoms rarely emerge for the first time 
later than early adolescence.
•	 Prevalence rates of oppositional defiant disorder are estimated at 3.3% among children 
and adolescents (aged 6–18 years). Some evidence suggests that overall prevalence of 
oppositional defiant disorder decreases beginning in adolescence and young adulthood.
•	 Oppositional defiant disorder is more common among children and adolescents whose 
families have experienced substantial disruptions in caregiving relationships, or in which 
parenting practices tend to be harsh, inconsistent or neglectful.
•	 Although oppositional and argumentative behaviours are common in typically developing 
children, unlike in oppositional defiant disorder, these behaviours tend to be transient and 
do not consistently negatively affect the child’s functioning and development.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with greater peer rejection, heightened 
interpersonal conflict, and increased risk of co-occurring and subsequent difficulties in 
adjustment throughout childhood and adulthood.
Culture-related features
•	 There is substantial variation in the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder across 
cultures. These differences may be related to cultural norms regarding uncooperative or 
defiant behaviour in children. For example, cultures that value obedience highly may 
have a lower threshold for considering a child’s behaviour to be noncompliant, defiant 
or disobedient. The behaviours relevant to assigning a diagnosis of oppositional defiant 
disorder should be evaluated in relation to social, cultural and subgroup norms.
•	 Variation in the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder 
across cultural groups may be related to differences in family structure and behaviour. 
Lower prevalence may be associated with stricter disciplinary practices at home, strong 
emphasis on educational or occupational attainment, and cultural values that disapprove 
of an antisocial lifestyle.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder is higher among school-aged boys than school-
aged girls, but does not appear to differ by gender at other points across the lifespan.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder
The behaviour problems associated with oppositional defiant disorder are largely characterized by 
interpersonal conflict with authority figures and difficulty getting along with others. In contrast, 
conduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of more severe 
and dissocial behaviour, in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or 
cultural norms, rules or laws are violated (e.g. aggression towards people or animals, destruction 
of property, deceitfulness or theft, serious violations of rules). However, individuals with conduct-
dissocial disorder often demonstrate a range or history of behaviour problems that may include 
the interpersonal difficulties characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder. Both diagnoses may 
be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder often have difficulty following directions, 
complying with rules and getting along with others. When these disruptive behaviours are 
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
better accounted for by inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity (e.g. failure to follow long and 
complicated directions, difficulty remaining seated or staying on task when asked), oppositional 
defiant disorder should not be diagnosed. In oppositional defiant disorder, the pattern of 
noncompliance is characterized by disobedience, beyond problems with attention and behavioural 
inhibition. However, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder 
commonly co-occur and both diagnoses may be assigned if the full diagnostic requirements for 
each are met.
Boundary with autism spectrum disorder
Noncompliant and other disruptive behaviours characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder 
should be distinguished from behaviour problems that are common among individuals with 
autism spectrum disorder. The key difference is that, in autism spectrum disorder, disruptive 
behaviours are often associated with specific environmental factors (e.g. sudden change in routine, 
aversive sensory stimulation), or the noncompliance is a consequence of the core symptoms of 
that disorder (e.g. social communication deficits, restricted, repetitive, inflexible patterns of 
behaviour, sensory sensitivities) rather than reflecting an intention to be provocative or spiteful. 
Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder do not typically exhibit the social communication 
deficits and restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that 
are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.
Boundary with mood disorders
It is common – particularly in children and adolescents – for patterns of noncompliance and 
symptoms of irritability/anger to occur as a feature of a mood episode. Specifically, noncompliance 
may result from a number of depressive symptoms (e.g. diminished interest or pleasure in 
activities, difficulty concentrating, hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, reduced energy). 
During manic, mixed or hypomanic episodes, individuals are less likely to follow rules and 
comply with directions. Moreover, in children and adolescents, depressive, manic or hypomanic 
mood can manifest as irritability. When the behaviour problems occur entirely in the context of 
mood episodes, a separate diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disorders
In children and adolescents, symptoms of anxiety and fear-related disorders can sometimes 
manifest as noncompliance, defiance and disobedience, including irritability or anger. For 
example, children may exhibit angry outbursts and refuse to comply with requests when 
presented with a task or a situation that makes them feel anxious (e.g. when a child with social 
anxiety disorder is asked to make a presentation in class). These behaviours are typically a 
manifestation of a desire on the part of the child or adolescent to avoid the feared situation or 
stimulus. Furthermore, children and adolescents with anxiety and fear-related disorders do not 
typically exhibit provocative, spiteful or vindictive behaviour. If the defiant behaviour occurs only 
in response to situations or stimuli that elicit anxiety, fear or panic, oppositional defiant disorder 
should not be diagnosed.
Boundary with intermittent explosive disorder
Regularly occurring severe temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or 
duration to the provocation are the core symptom of intermittent explosive disorder but may also 
occur in the context of oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger. Individuals 
with oppositional defiant disorder with chronic irritability-anger typically display other features 
of oppositional defiant disorder, including defiant, headstrong or vindictive behaviours, which 
are not characteristic of intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with intermittent 
explosive disorder are more likely to exhibit significant physical aggression.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Oppositional defiant disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Conduct-dissocial disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviour in which the basic rights of others or major 
age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules or laws are violated is required for diagnosis. 
Typically, multiple behaviours are involved, including one or more of the following:
•	 aggression towards people or animals, such as bullying, threatening or intimidating others, 
instigating physical fights, using weapons that can cause serious physical harm to others 
(such as a brick, broken bottle, knife or gun), physical cruelty to people, physical cruelty 
to animals, aggressive forms of stealing (e.g. mugging, purse snatching, extortion), or 
forcing someone into sexual activity;
•	 destruction of property, such as deliberate fire setting with the intention of causing serious 
damage or deliberate destruction of others’ property (e.g. purposely breaking other 
children’s toys, breaking windows, scratching cars, slashing tires);
•	 deceitfulness or theft, such as stealing items of value (e.g. shoplifting, forgery), lying to 
obtain goods or favours or to avoid obligations (e.g. “conning” others), or breaking into 
someone’s house, building or car;
•	 serious violations of rules, such as children or adolescents repeatedly staying out all night 
despite parental prohibitions, repeatedly running away from home, or often skipping 
school or work without permission.
•	 The pattern of behaviour must be persistent and recurrent, including multiple incidents 
of the types of behaviours described above over an extended period of time (e.g. at least 
1 year). The mere commission of one or more delinquent acts is not sufficient for the 
diagnosis.
•	 The behaviour pattern results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, 
educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
Specifiers for age of onset
Two subtypes related to age of onset can be specified in individuals who meet the diagnostic 
requirements for conduct-dissocial disorder.
Conduct-dissocial disorder, childhood onset
•	 All diagnostic requirements for conduct-dissocial disorder are met.
•	 One or more features of the disorder have clearly been present and persistent during 
childhood prior to adolescence (e.g. before 10 years of age).

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Conduct-dissocial disorder

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
Conduct-dissocial disorder, adolescent onset
•	 All diagnostic requirements for conduct-dissocial disorder are met.
•	 None of the features of the disorder were present prior to adolescence (e.g. before 10 years 
of age).
Conduct-dissocial disorder, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder may be part of a delinquent peer group where 
delinquent activities are often conducted in association with peers. This may be particularly 
common among those with adolescent onset.
•	 The relationship between conduct-dissocial disorder and oppositional defiant disorder has 
historically been conceptualized as hierarchical and developmental in nature, with conduct-
dissocial disorder generally considered more severe than, and commonly preceded by, 
oppositional defiant disorder. However, conduct-dissocial disorder frequently co-occurs 
and can be diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, particularly among individuals 
with a more persistent history of behaviour problems.
•	 Individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions (see 
p. 548) and individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, childhood onset, are at greater 
risk of exhibiting a more persistent and severe pattern of antisocial behaviour over time. 
However, the subtypes for age of onset and the specifier for prosocial emotions are distinct 
characteristics that should be considered separately. In particular, childhood onset does 
not necessarily indicate that the individual will exhibit limited prosocial emotions.
•	 Conduct-dissocial disorder frequently co-occurs with attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, developmental learning disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood 
disorders, and disorders due to substance use.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Engaging in political protests should not be regarded as indicating the presence of conduct-
dissocial disorder.
•	 The behaviours that contribute to a diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder can include 
criminal offences, and may entail legal or disciplinary repercussions – particularly for 
adolescents and adults. At the same time, many individuals who commit such criminal 
offences do not exhibit a persistent and recurrent pattern of antisocial behaviour in which 
the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules or laws 
are violated. Criminal behaviours may occur impulsively or opportunistically, or in relation 
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Conduct-dissocial disorder
6C91.1
6C91.Z

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

to substance use or intoxication. Clinical assessment and diagnosis should focus on the 
broader pattern of behaviour rather than solely on the criminality of specific behaviours 
or incidents.
Course features
•	 Earlier age of onset and greater symptom severity are predictive of worse prognosis, with 
these individuals more likely to engage in criminal behaviour and substance abuse, and 
to experience additional co-occurring mental and behavioural disorder diagnoses during 
adulthood.
•	 The course of conduct-dissocial disorder is highly variable, with some individuals 
experiencing a full remission of symptoms by adulthood. Initial symptoms of conduct-
dissocial disorder are typically less severe in form (e.g. lying), but may progress in their 
severity over time (e.g. assault). There are significant individual differences in course 
features and progression of symptoms over time.
•	 When conduct-dissocial disorder is present in adulthood, it has generally been preceded 
by a history of serious behaviour problems during childhood and adolescence.
•	 The persistence of conduct-dissocial disorder into adulthood is often marked by continuity 
in types of behaviour problems (e.g. property violations in contrast to theft). Individuals 
with conduct-dissocial disorder who are violent during adolescence typically continue 
to engage in more frequent violence than their peers in adulthood. Status offences (e.g. 
running away, truancy) are less relevant in adulthood, but are a risk factor for continuing 
rule-breaking behaviour and criminal arrest.
Developmental presentations
•	 Although onset of conduct-dissocial disorder can occur in early childhood during the 
preschool years, typical age of onset is during early to middle adolescence. Onset of 
conduct-dissocial disorder is rare after the age of 16 years.
Culture-related features
•	 Assessment of conduct problems should account for contextual factors to determine 
whether a diagnosis is appropriate. In some cultural settings, for example, school-aged 
children may be away from school for long periods of seasonal employment rather than for 
conduct reasons. Alternatively, in communities with high levels of organized violence (e.g. 
gangs) or in the midst of civil conflict or war (e.g. where children as recruited as soldiers), 
children may be coerced into participating in interpersonal violence or property theft, 
which they may carry out for their own survival. A diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder 
should not be assigned in such cases.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Conduct-dissocial disorder

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
•	 Conduct-dissocial disorder in adolescents often co-occurs with disorders due to substance 
use – especially those associated with use of alcohol. The rates of co-occurrence are 
influenced by sociocultural variation in availability of substances.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Conduct-dissocial disorder is more common among males.
•	 Males with conduct-dissocial disorder are more likely to exhibit symptoms of stealing, 
vandalism, fighting and school discipline problems, whereas females are more likely to 
exhibit lying, truancy, substance abuse, absconding and prostitution.
•	 Males with conduct-dissocial disorder more commonly exhibit both physical and relational 
aggression, whereas females are more likely to exclusively exhibit relational aggression.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
For a diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder to be assigned, the pattern of behaviour must be 
severe and dissocial (i.e. violating major rules, norms, or the rights of others), such that it extends 
beyond the noncompliant and defiant behaviours that are characteristic of oppositional defiant 
disorder. However, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder frequently co-
occur, particularly among adolescents and individuals with a more persistent history of behaviour 
problems, and may be diagnosed together if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may exhibit disruptive behaviours as a 
result of their impulsivity or hyperactivity; however, these disruptive behaviours are not typically 
severe and dissocial in nature (i.e. they do not violate major rules, norms or the rights of others), 
and therefore would not warrant an additional diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder. However, 
conduct-dissocial disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can co-occur, and both 
may be diagnosed if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with mood disorders
Conduct problems, aggressive behaviours, risky behaviours and irritability/anger can occur in 
the context of mood episodes (depressive, manic, mixed or hypomanic). Moreover, in children 
and adolescents, depressive, manic or hypomanic mood can manifest as irritability. When the 
behaviour problems occur entirely in the context of mood episodes, a separate diagnosis of 
conduct-dissocial disorder is generally not warranted.
Boundary with intermittent explosive disorder
Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder may come into conflict with other people and 
the law because of their explosive outbursts, but these episodes do not constitute a more general 
pattern of antisocial behaviour characteristic of conduct-dissocial disorder (e.g. rule violations, 
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Conduct-dissocial disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

lying, theft). In addition, intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by impulsive aggression, 
while aggression in conduct-dissocial disorder is often premeditated and instrumental.
Boundary with personality disorder
Conduct-dissocial disorder is not a personality disorder, although it is related to specific personality 
disorder categories in the clinical and research nomenclature (i.e. dissocial personality disorder, 
antisocial personality disorder). Personality disorder is characterized by a relatively enduring 
and pervasive disturbance in how individuals experience and interpret themselves, others and 
the world that results in maladaptive patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional 
expression and behaviour. These maladaptive patterns lead to significant problems in psychosocial 
functioning that are particularly evident in interpersonal relationships, manifested across a range 
of personal and social situations (i.e. not limited to specific relationships or situations). Individuals 
with personality disorder may have prominent dissocial features as an aspect of personality traits. 
The diagnosis of conduct-dissocial disorder is made based on a recurrent pattern of antisocial 
behaviour that may range in duration from a discrete period lasting a number of months to a 
pattern that persists across the lifespan. Conduct-dissocial disorder and personality disorder can 
co-occur, and both may be diagnosed if the full diagnostic requirements for each are met.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
If the pattern of dissocial behaviour is limited to obtaining or using illicit substances, or if 
the behaviour is exclusively related to the effects of intoxication, dependence or withdrawal, 
conduct-dissocial disorder should not be diagnosed, and a disorder due to substance use should 
be considered instead. At the same time, co-occurrence of episodes of dissocial behaviour and 
substance use is common among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder. This distinction may 
therefore depend on a complex clinical judgement that takes into account the onset, sequencing 
and context of the relevant behaviours. However, conduct-dissocial disorder and disorders due to 
substance use frequently co-occur, and both may be diagnosed if the full diagnostic requirements 
for each are met.
Specifier applicable to oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-
dissocial disorder
Specifiers for limited or typical prosocial emotions
•	 The with limited prosocial emotions specifier may be applied to individuals who meet the 
diagnostic requirements for oppositional defiant disorder or conduct-dissocial disorder 
and also exhibit a pattern of limited prosocial emotions sometimes referred to as “callous 
and unemotional traits”. Individuals with these characteristics represent a minority of those 
with disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders diagnoses. The with limited prosocial 
emotions specifier represents a relatively more severe and less common presentation of 
disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders.
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders | Conduct-dissocial disorder

Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
In evaluating prosocial emotions, it is important to obtain information from others who have 
known the individual for an extended period of time, in addition to the individual’s self-report of 
their own behaviours and experience.
Limited or typical prosocial emotions in individuals with oppositional defiant disorder or 
conduct-dissocial disorder can be specified as follows.
with limited prosocial emotions
•	 In the context of a diagnosis of disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, this specifier 
represents the presence of a characteristic social-emotional pattern in which several of the 
following features are repeatedly manifested:
•	 limited or absent empathy or sensitivity to others’ feelings or concern for their distress – the 
individual is more concerned with how events and their own behaviours affect themselves 
than with how they affect others, even if they cause harm;
•	 limited or absent remorse, shame or guilt over their own behaviour (unless prompted by 
being apprehended), lack of concern about the consequences of their actions on others 
and relative indifference towards the probability of punishment;
•	 limited or absent concern over poor/problematic performance in school, work or other 
important activities – the individual putting forth little effort and blaming others for 
their poor performance;
•	 limited or shallow expression of emotions, particularly positive or loving feelings towards 
others – the individual’s emotional expression possibly appearing shallow, superficial, 
insincere or instrumental.
•	 This pattern is pervasive across situations and relationships (i.e. the specifier should not 
be applied based on a single characteristic, a single relationship or a single instance of 
behaviour).
•	 The pattern is persistent over time (e.g. at least 1 year).
•	 Among individuals with oppositional defiant disorder, those with limited prosocial 
emotions tend to display a particularly extreme and stable pattern of oppositional 
behaviours.
•	 Among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, those with limited prosocial emotions 
tend to display a particularly severe, aggressive and stable pattern of antisocial behaviours.
with typical prosocial emotions
•	 In the context of a diagnosis of disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, this specifier 
represents a more common pattern of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct-dissocial 
disorder that is not characterized by the features of limited prosocial emotions.
•	 Although some features similar to limited prosocial emotions (e.g. low concern, limited 
remorse) may be evident at times, they are generally infrequent, transitory and less 
pronounced, and do not represent a persistent pervasive pattern of social-emotional 
deficits.
•	 Most individuals with disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders exhibit typical 
prosocial emotions.

Personality disorders and

Mild personality disorder.
Personality refers to an individual’s characteristic way of behaving and experiencing life, and of 
perceiving and interpreting themselves, other people, events and situations. Personality disorder 
is a marked disturbance in personality functioning, which is nearly always associated with 
considerable personal and social disruption. The central manifestations of personality disorder 
are impairments in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g. identity, self-worth, capacity for 
self-direction) and/or problems in interpersonal functioning (e.g. developing and maintaining 
close and mutually satisfying relationships, understanding others’ perspectives, managing 
conflict in relationships). Impairments in self-functioning and/or interpersonal functioning are 
manifested in maladaptive (e.g. inflexible or poorly regulated) patterns of cognition, emotional 
experience, emotional expression and behaviour.
The following diagnostic requirements for personality disorder first present a set of essential 
features, all of which must be present to diagnose a personality disorder. Once the diagnosis of a 
personality disorder has been established, it should be described in terms of its level of severity:
Moderate personality disorder.
Severe personality disorder.
Personality disorder, severity unspecified.
Also listed in this grouping is:
QE50.7
Personality difficulty
Personality difficulty is not classified as a mental disorder but rather is listed in the grouping of 
problems associated with interpersonal interactions in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health 
status or contact with health services.
Personality disorder and personality difficulty can be further described using five trait domain 
specifiers. These describe the characteristics of the individual’s personality that are most prominent 
and that contribute to personality disturbance. As many as necessary to describe personality 
functioning should be applied.

Trait domain specifiers that may be recorded include the following:
6D11.0
Negative affectivity
Detachment
Dissociality
Disinhibition
Anankastia
More detailed guidance about the personality characteristics reflected in the trait domain 
specifiers is provided in the following sections.
Clinicians may also wish to add an additional specifier:
Borderline pattern
The borderline pattern specifier has been included to enhance the clinical utility of the classification 
of personality disorder. Specifically, use of this specifier may facilitate the identification of 
individuals who may respond to certain psychotherapeutic treatments.
A complete description of a particular case of personality disorder includes the rating of the 
severity level and the assignment of the applicable trait domain specifiers (e.g. mild personality 
disorder with negative affectivity and anankastia; severe personality disorder with dissociality and 
disinhibition.) The borderline pattern specifier is considered optional but, if used, should ideally 
be used in combination with the trait domain specifiers (e.g. moderate personality disorder with 
negative affectivity, dissociality and disinhibition, borderline pattern).
General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 An enduring disturbance characterized by problems in functioning of aspects of the 
self (e.g. identity, self-worth, accuracy of self-view, self-direction) and/or interpersonal 
dysfunction (e.g. ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfying relationships, 
ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships) is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 The disturbance has persisted over an extended period of time (e.g. lasting 2 years or more).
•	 The disturbance is manifested in patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional 
expression and behaviour that are maladaptive (e.g. inflexible or poorly regulated).
•	 The disturbance is manifested across a range of personal and social situations (i.e. is not 
limited to specific relationships or social roles), although it may be consistently evoked by 
particular types of circumstances and not others.

6D11.5
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Personality disorders and related traits
•	 The symptoms are not due to the direct effects of a medication or substance, including 
withdrawal effects, and are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, a disease 
of the nervous system or another medical condition.
•	 The disturbance is associated with substantial distress or significant impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
•	 Personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the patterns of behaviour characterizing 
the personality disturbance are developmentally appropriate (e.g. problems related 
to establishing an independent self-identity during adolescence) or can be explained 
primarily by social or cultural factors, including sociopolitical conflict.
Severity of personality disorder
The areas of personality functioning shown in Box 6.2 should be considered in making a 
severity determination for individuals who meet the general diagnostic requirements for 
personality disorder.
Box 6.2. Aspects of personality functioning that contribute to 
severity determination in personality disorder
Degree and pervasiveness of disturbances in functioning of aspects of the self

of self is variable and inconsistent or overly rigid and fixed)
•	 Ability to maintain an overall positive and stable sense of self-worth
•	 Accuracy of one’s view of one’s characteristics, strengths, limitations
•	 Capacity for self-direction (ability to plan, choose, and implement appropriate goals)
Degree and pervasiveness of interpersonal dysfunction across various contexts 
and relationships (e.g. romantic relationships, school/work, parent-child, family, 
friendships, peer contexts)
•	 Interest in engaging in relationships with others
•	 Ability to understand and appreciate others’ perspectives
•	 Ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfying relationships
•	 Ability to manage conflict in relationships
Pervasiveness, severity and chronicity of emotional, cognitive and behavioural 
manifestations of the personality dysfunction
•	 Emotional manifestations
•	 Range and appropriateness of emotional experience and expression
•	 Tendency to be emotionally over- or underreactive
•	 Ability to recognize and acknowledge emotions that are difficult or unwanted by the 
individual (e.g. anger, sadness)
•	 Cognitive manifestations
•	 Accuracy of situational and interpersonal appraisals, especially under stress
•	 Ability to make appropriate decisions in situations of uncertainty
•	 Appropriate stability and flexibility of belief systems
•	 Behavioural manifestations
•	 Flexibility in controlling impulses and modulating behaviour based on the situation 
and consideration of the consequences
•	 Appropriateness of behavioural responses to intense emotions and stressful 
circumstances (e.g. propensity to self-harm or violence)

distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or 
other important areas of functioning

Mild personality disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 All general diagnostic requirements for personality disorder are met.
•	 Disturbances affect some areas of functioning of the self but not others (e.g. problems with 
self-direction in the absence of problems with stability and coherence of identity or self-
worth; see Box 6.2), or affect all areas but are of mild severity, and may not be apparent in 
some contexts.
•	 There are problems in many interpersonal relationships or in performance of expected 
occupational and social roles, but some relationships are maintained and/or some roles 
fulfilled.
•	 Specific manifestations of personality disturbances are generally of mild severity (see the 
examples below).
•	 Mild personality disorder is typically not associated with substantial harm to self or others.
•	 Mild personality disorder may be associated with substantial distress or with impairment in 
personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning 
that is either limited to circumscribed areas (e.g. romantic relationships; employment) or 
present in more areas but of milder severity.
Examples of specific personality disturbances in mild personality disorder
Note: this list of examples is not exhaustive, and it is not intended to suggest that all items will be 
present in any single individual.
•	 The individual’s sense of self may be somewhat contradictory and inconsistent with how 
others view them.
•	 The individual has difficulty recovering from injuries to self-esteem.
•	 The individual’s ability to set appropriate goals and to work towards them is compromised; 
the individual has difficulty handling even minor setbacks.
•	 The individual may have conflicts with supervisors and co-workers, but is generally able 
to sustain employment.
•	 The individual’s limitations in the ability to understand and appreciate others’ perspectives 
create difficulties in development of close and mutually satisfying relationships.
•	 There may be estrangement in some relationships, but relationships are more commonly 
characterized by intermittent or frequent minor conﬂicts that are not so severe that they 
cause serious and longstanding disruption.
•	 Alternatively, relationships may be characterized by dependence and avoidance of conflict 
by giving in to others, even at some cost to themselves.
•	 Under stress, there may be some distortions in the individual’s situational and interpersonal 
appraisals, but reality testing typically remains intact.

Moderate personality disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 All general diagnostic requirements for personality disorder are met.
•	 Disturbances affect multiple areas of functioning of the self (e.g. stability and coherence of 
identity, self-worth, self-direction; see Box 6.2) and are of moderate severity.
•	 There are marked problems in most interpersonal relationships, and the performance of 
most expected social and occupational roles is compromised to some degree.
•	 Relationships are likely to be characterized by conflict, avoidance, withdrawal or extreme 
dependency (e.g. few friendships maintained, persistent conflict in work relationships 
and consequent occupational problems, romantic relationships characterized by serious 
disruption or inappropriate submissiveness).
•	 Specific manifestations of personality disturbance are generally of moderate severity (see 
the examples below).
•	 Moderate personality disorder is sometimes associated with harm to self or others.
•	 Moderate personality disorder is associated with marked impairment in personal, family,

present in any single individual.
•	 The individual’s sense of self may become incoherent in times of crisis.
•	 The individual has considerable difficulty maintaining positive self-esteem. Alternatively, 
the individual has an unrealistically positive self-view that is not modified by evidence to 
the contrary.
•	 The individual exhibits poor emotion regulation in the face of setbacks, often becoming 
highly upset and giving up easily. Alternatively, the individual may persist unreasonably in 
pursuit of goals that have no chance of success.
•	 The individual may exhibit little genuine interest in or eﬀorts towards sustained 
employment.
•	 Major limitations in the ability to understand and appreciate others’ perspectives hinder 
development of close and mutually satisfying relationships.
•	 There are persistent problems in those relationships that do exist. They may be characterized 
by frequent, serious and volatile conflict, or be significantly unbalanced (e.g. the individual 
is highly dominant or highly submissive).
•	 Under stress there are marked distortions in the individual’s situational and interpersonal 
appraisals. There may be mild dissociative states or psychotic-like beliefs or perceptions 
(e.g. paranoid ideas).

and expression, and impulses, as well as other aspects of behaviour (e.g. perseveration, 
indecision).
•	 The individual is largely unable to set and pursue realistic goals.

extremely one-sided, unstable or highly conflictual, often to the point of violence. Family 
relationships are absent (despite having living relatives) or marred by signiﬁcant conﬂict.
•	 The individual has extreme difficulty acknowledging difficult or unwanted emotions (e.g. 
does not recognize or acknowledge experiencing anger, sadness or other emotions).
•	 The individual is unwilling or unable to sustain regular work due to lack of interest or 
eﬀort, poor performance (e.g. failure to complete assignments or perform expected roles, 
unreliability), interpersonal diﬃculties or inappropriate behaviour (e.g. ﬁts of temper, 
insubordination).
•	 Under stress, there are extreme distortions in the individual’s situational and interpersonal 
appraisals. There are often dissociative states or psychotic-like beliefs or perceptions (e.g. 
extreme paranoid reactions).

Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Personality disorders and related traits
Secondary-parented category in personality disorders and 
related traits
Personality difficulty
As noted above, personality difficulty is not considered a mental disorder but rather is listed 
in the grouping of problems associated with interpersonal interactions in Chapter 24 on 
factors influencing health status or contact with health services. Personality difficulty refers to 
pronounced personality characteristics that may affect treatment or health services but do not 
rise to the level of severity to merit a diagnosis of personality disorder.
Personality difficulty is characterized by longstanding difficulties (e.g. at least 2 years) in the 
individual’s way of experiencing and thinking about the self, others and the world. In contrast to 
personality disorder, personality difficulty is manifested in cognitive and emotional experience 
and expression only intermittently (e.g. during times of stress) or at low intensity. Personality 
difficulty is typically associated with some problems in functioning, but these are insufficiently 
severe to cause notable disruption in social, occupational and interpersonal relationships, or may 
be limited to specific relationships or situations.
Specifiers for prominent trait domains in personality disorder
Trait domain specifiers may be applied to personality disorders or personality difficulty to describe 
the characteristics of the individual’s personality that are most prominent and that contribute to 
personality disturbance.
Trait domains are continuous with normal personality characteristics in individuals who do not 
have personality disorder or personality difficulty. They are not diagnostic categories but rather 
represent a set of dimensions that correspond to the underlying structure of personality.
As many trait domain specifiers may be applied as necessary to describe personality functioning. 
Individuals with more severe personality disturbance tend to have a greater number of prominent 
trait domains. However, a person may have a severe personality disorder and manifest only one 
prominent trait domain (e.g. detachment).
Trait domain specifiers that may be recorded include the following.
Negative affectivity
The core feature of the negative affectivity trait domain (sometimes referred to as “neuroticism”) 
is the tendency to experience a broad range of negative emotions. Common manifestations of 
negative affectivity, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include 
the following.
QE50.7
6D11.0
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Experiencing a broad range of negative emotions with a frequency and intensity out 
of proportion to the situation
Common negative emotions include – but are not limited to – anxiety, worry, depression, 
vulnerability, fear, anger, hostility, guilt and shame. The particular negative emotions that are most 
characteristic of any particular person vary across individuals, and are largely dependent on the 
presence or degree of other trait domains. For example, individuals with prominent dissociality 
are more likely to experience “externalizing” negative emotions (e.g. anger, hostility, contempt), 
whereas those with prominent detachment are more likely to experience “internalizing” negative 
emotions (e.g. anxiety, depression, pessimism, guilt).
Emotional lability and poor emotion regulation
Individuals with prominent negative affectivity are overreactive to both their own negative 
cognitions and to external events. They can become overwrought through their own thought 
processes, such as by ruminating over their shortcomings or past mistakes; over real or perceived 
threats, slights or insults; or over potential future problems. They are overreactive to external 
threats or criticism, problems and setbacks. They have low frustration tolerance and easily 
become visibly upset over even minor issues. They often experience and display multiple emotions 
simultaneously, or vacillate among a range of emotions in a short period of time. Once upset, they 
have difficulty regaining their composure and must rely on others or on leaving the situation to 
calm down.
Negativistic attitudes
Individuals with prominent negative affectivity typically reject others’ suggestions or advice, 
arguing that enacting others’ ideas would be too complicated or difficult; or that the suggested 
actions would not lead to the desired outcomes, or have a high likelihood of negative consequences. 
The manner of rejection is largely dependent on the individual’s other traits. For example, those 
with prominent detachment are most likely to blame themselves for the likely difficulties or poor 
outcomes, whereas those with prominent dissociality are most likely to blame others for offering 
such bad ideas.
Low self-esteem and self-confidence
Individuals with prominent negative affectivity may exhibit low self-esteem and self-confidence 
in several different ways. These include avoidance of situations and activities that are judged to 
be too difficult (e.g. intellectually, physically, socially, interpersonally, emotionally), even despite 
evidence to the contrary; dependency, which may be manifested in frequent reliance on others for 
advice, direction and other kinds of help; envy of others’ abilities and indicators of success; and, in 
more severe cases of low self-esteem, believing themselves to be useless, to have lived a worthless 
life, or to be incapable of accomplishing anything of value, which may be associated with suicidal 
ideation or behaviours.
Mistrustfulness
Interpersonally, this is typically manifested in suspicion that others have ill intent, and that 
neutral or even benign remarks and positive behaviours are hidden threats, slights or insults. 
Individuals with prominent negative affectivity tend to hold grudges and be unforgiving, even 
over long time periods. In non-interpersonal situations, this mistrustfulness typically takes the 
form of bitterness and cynicism (e.g. the belief that the “system is rigged”).
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Personality disorders and related traits
Detachment
The core feature of the detachment trait domain is the tendency to maintain interpersonal distance 
(social detachment) and emotional distance (emotional detachment). Common manifestations 
of detachment, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include 
the following.
Social detachment
Social detachment is characterized by avoidance of social interactions, lack of friendships and 
avoidance of intimacy. Individuals with prominent detachment do not enjoy social interactions, 
and avoid all kinds of social contact and social situations as far as possible. They engage in little to 
no “small talk”, even if initiated by others (e.g. at store check-out counters), seek out employment 
that does not involve interactions with others, and even refuse promotions if these would entail 
more interaction with others. They have few to no friends or even casual acquaintances. Their 
interactions with family members tend to be minimal and superficial. They rarely, if ever, engage 
in any intimate relationships, and are not particularly interested in sexual relations.
Emotional detachment
Emotional detachment is characterized by reserve, aloofness and limited emotional expression 
and experience. Individuals with prominent detachment keep to themselves as far as possible, 
even in obligatory social situations. They are typically aloof, responding to direct attempts at 
social engagement only briefly and in ways that discourage further conversation. Emotional 
detachment also encompasses emotional inexpressiveness, both verbally and non-verbally. 
Individuals with prominent detachment do not talk about their feelings, and it is difficult to 
discern what they might be feeling from their behaviours. In extreme cases, there is a lack of 
emotional experience itself, and they are non-reactive to either negative or positive events, with a 
limited capacity for enjoyment.
Dissociality
The core feature of the dissociality trait domain is disregard for the rights and feelings of others, 
encompassing both self-centredness and lack of empathy. Common manifestations of dissociality, 
not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following.
Self-centredness
Self-centredness in individuals with prominent dissociality is manifested in a sense of entitlement, 
believing and acting as if they deserve – without further justification – whatever they want, 
preferentially above what others may want or need, and that this “fact” should be obvious to others. 
Self-centredness can be manifested both actively/intentionally and passively/unintentionally. 
Active – and usually intentional – manifestations of self-centredness include expectation of 
others’ admiration, attention-seeking behaviours to ensure being the centre of others’ focus, and 
negative behaviours (e.g. anger, “temper tantrums”, denigrating others) when the admiration 
and attention that the individual expects are not granted. Typically, such individuals believe that 
they have many admirable qualities, that their accomplishments are outstanding, that they have 
achieved or will achieve greatness, and that others should admire them. Passive and unintentional 
manifestations of self-centredness reflect a kind of obliviousness that other individuals matter as 
much as oneself. In this aspect of dissociality, the individual’s concern is with their own needs, 
desires and comfort, and those of others simply are not considered.
6D11.2
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder
6D11.1

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Lack of empathy
Lack of empathy is manifested in indifference to whether one’s actions inconvenience others or 
hurt them in any way (e.g. emotionally, socially, financially, physically). As a result, individuals 
with prominent dissociality are often deceptive and manipulative, exploiting people and situations 
to get what they want and think they deserve. This may include being mean and physically 
aggressive. In the extreme, this aspect of dissociality can be manifested in callousness with regard 
to others’ suffering and ruthlessness in obtaining one’s goals, such that these individuals may 
be physically violent with little to no provocation, and may even take pleasure in inflicting pain 
and harm. Note that this aspect of dissociality does not necessarily imply that individuals with 
prominent dissociality do not cognitively understand the feelings of others; rather, they are not 
concerned about them and instead are likely to use this understanding to exploit others.
Disinhibition
The core feature of the disinhibition trait domain is the tendency to act rashly based on immediate 
external or internal stimuli (i.e. sensations, emotions, thoughts), without consideration of 
potential negative consequences. Common manifestations of disinhibition, not all of which may 
be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following.
Impulsivity
Individuals with prominent disinhibition tend to act rashly based on whatever is compelling at 
the moment, without consideration of negative consequences for themselves or others, including 
putting themselves or others at physical risk. They have difficulty delaying reward or satisfaction, 
and tend to pursue immediately available short-term pleasures or potential benefits. In this way, 
the trait is strongly associated with such behaviours as substance use, gambling and impulsive 
sexual activity.
Distractibility
Individuals with prominent disinhibition also have difficulty staying focused on important and 
necessary tasks that require sustained effort. They quickly become bored or frustrated with 
difficult, routine or tedious tasks, and are easily distracted by extraneous stimuli, such as others’ 
conversations. Even in the absence of distractions, they have difficulty keeping their attention 
focused and persisting on tasks, and tend to scan the environment for more enjoyable options.
Irresponsibility
Individuals with prominent disinhibition are unreliable and lack a sense of accountability for 
their actions. As a result, they often do not complete work assignments or perform expected 
duties; they fail to meet deadlines, do not follow through on commitments and promises, and are 
late to or miss formal and informal appointments and meetings because they allow themselves to 
become engaged in something more compelling that has caught their attention.
Recklessness
Individuals with prominent disinhibition lack an appropriate sense of caution. They tend to 
overestimate their abilities and thus frequently do things that are beyond their skill level, without 
considering potential safety risks. Individuals with prominent disinhibition may engage in reckless 
driving or dangerous sports, or perform other activities that put them or others in physical danger 
without sufficient preparation or training.

Personality disorders and related traits
Lack of planning
Individuals with prominent disinhibition prefer spontaneous over planned activities, leaving 
their options open should a more attractive opportunity arise. They tend to focus on immediate 
feelings, sensations and thoughts, with relatively little attention paid to longer-term or even short-
term goals. When they do make plans, they often fail to follow through on them, so they are 
seldom able to reach long-term goals, and often fail to achieve even short-term goals.
Anankastia
The core feature of the anankastia trait domain is a narrow focus on one’s rigid standard of perfection 
and of right and wrong, on controlling one’s own and others’ behaviour, and on controlling 
situations to ensure conformity to these standards. Common manifestations of anankastia, not 
all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include the following.
Perfectionism 
Perfectionism is manifested in concern with social rules, obligations, norms of right and wrong; 
scrupulous attention to detail; rigid, systematic, day-to-day routines; excessive scheduling and 
planning; and an emphasis on organization, orderliness and neatness. Individuals with prominent 
anankastia have a very clear and detailed personal sense of perfection and imperfection that 
extends beyond community standards to encompass the individual’s idiosyncratic notions of 
what is perfect and right. They believe strongly that everyone should follow all rules exactly and 
meet all obligations. Individuals with prominent anankastia may redo the work of others because 
it does not meet their perfectionistic standards. They have difficulty in interpersonal relationships 
because they hold others to the same standards as themselves, and are inflexible in their views.
Emotional and behavioural constraint
Emotional and behavioural constraint is manifested in rigid control over emotional expression, 
stubbornness and inflexibility, risk-avoidance, perseveration and deliberativeness. Individuals 
with prominent anankastic traits tightly control their own emotional expression, and disapprove 
of others’ displays of emotion. They are inflexible and lack spontaneity, stubbornly insisting on 
following set schedules and adhering to plans. Their risk-avoidance includes both refusal to 
engage in obviously risky activities and a more general overconcern about avoiding potential 
negative consequences of any activity. They often perseverate and have difficulty disengaging 
from tasks because they are perceived as not yet perfect down to the last detail. They are highly 
deliberative and have difficulty making decisions due to concern that they have not considered 
every aspect and all alternatives to ensure that the right decision is made.
Borderline pattern
Note: the borderline pattern specifier has been included to enhance the clinical utility of 
the classification of personality disorder. There is considerable overlap between this pattern 
and information contained in the trait domain specifiers (most typically negative affectivity, 
dissociality and disinhibition). However, use of this specifier may facilitate the identification of 
individuals who may respond to certain psychotherapeutic treatments.
6D11.4
6D11.5
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

The borderline pattern specifier may be applied to individuals whose pattern of personality 
disturbance is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, 
self-image and affects, and marked impulsivity, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:
•	 frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment;
•	 a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, which may be characterized 
by vacillations between idealization and devaluation, typically associated with both strong 
desire for and fear of closeness and intimacy;
•	 identity disturbance, manifested in markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense 
of self;
•	 a tendency to act rashly in states of high negative affect, leading to potentially self-damaging 
behaviours (e.g. risky sexual behaviour, reckless driving, excessive alcohol or substance 
use, binge eating);
•	 recurrent episodes of self-harm (e.g. suicide attempts or gestures, self-mutilation);
•	 emotional instability due to marked reactivity of mood – fluctuations of mood that may 
be triggered either internally (e.g. by one’s own thoughts) or by external events, as a 
consequence of which, the individual experiences intense dysphoric mood states, which 
typically last for a few hours but may last for up to several days;
•	 chronic feelings of emptiness;
•	 inappropriate intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, manifested in frequent displays 
of temper (e.g. yelling or screaming, throwing or breaking things, getting into physical 
fights);
•	 transient dissociative symptoms or psychotic-like features (e.g. brief hallucinations, 
paranoia) in situations of high affective arousal.
Other manifestations of borderline pattern, not all of which may be present in a given individual 
at a given time, include the following:
•	 a view of the self as inadequate, bad, guilty, disgusting and contemptible;
•	 an experience of the self as profoundly different and isolated from other people, and a 
painful sense of alienation and pervasive loneliness;
•	 proneness to rejection hypersensitivity, problems in establishing and maintaining 
consistent and appropriate levels of trust in interpersonal relationships, and frequent 
misinterpretation of social signals.
Additional clinical features of personality disorder
•	 Personality disorder tends to arise when individuals’ life experiences provide inadequate 
support for typical personality development, given the person’s temperament (the aspect 
of personality that is considered to be innate, reflecting basic genetic and neurobiological 
processes). Thus, early life adversity is a risk factor for later development of personality 
disorder, as it is for many other mental disorders. However, it is not determinative: some 
individuals’ temperament allows typical personality development despite an extremely 
adverse early environment. Nonetheless, in the context of a history of early adversity, 
ongoing behavioural, emotional or interpersonal difficulties suggest that a personality 
disorder diagnosis should be considered.
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Personality disorders and related traits
•	 Personality disorder often complicates and lengthens treatment of other clinical 
syndromes. Thus, poor or incomplete response to standard treatments of, for example, 
depressive disorders and anxiety and fear-related disorders may suggest the presence of 
personality disorder. Relatedly, persistent functional impairment after resolution of the 
clinical syndrome(s) being treated may suggest the presence of personality disorder.
•	 There is often considerable variability in the degree to which individuals and those 
around them agree that the individual’s behaviours reflect a particular trait. If there is a 
marked discrepancy between an individual’s self-description and the kinds of problematic 
behaviours exhibited, it often is helpful to interview someone who knows the person 
well. Marked differences between the individual’s self-description and the informant’s 
description may be suggestive of personality disorder.
Boundary with normality (threshold) for personality disorder
•	 Personality refers to an individual’s characteristic way of behaving and experiencing 
life, and of perceiving and interpreting themselves, other people, events and situations. 
Personality is manifested most directly in how individuals think and feel about themselves 
and their interpersonal relationships, how they behave in response to those thoughts and 
feelings and in response to others’ behaviours, and how they react to events in their lives and 
changes in the environment. An important characteristic of non-disordered personality is 
sufficient flexibility to react appropriately and to adapt to other people’s behaviours, life 
events and changes in the environment. In personality disorder, patterns of cognition, 
emotional experience, emotional expression and behaviour are sufficiently maladaptive 
(e.g. inflexible or poorly regulated) that they result in substantial distress or significant 
impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas 
of functioning.
•	 To warrant a diagnosis of personality disorder, personality disturbance must be manifested 
across a range of personal and social situations over an extended period of time (e.g. 
lasting 2 years or more). Behaviour patterns that are apparent only in the context of 
specific relationships, social roles or environmental circumstances, or that have lasted for 
a shorter period of time, are not a sufficient basis for a diagnosis of personality disorder. 
Instead, the possibility that such behaviour patterns are a response to environmental 
circumstances must be considered. A focus on problems in the relevant relationship or in 
the environment (e.g. with family or school) may be more appropriate than a diagnosis of 
personality disorder in such cases.
Course features
•	 Manifestations of personality disturbance tend to appear first in childhood, increase 
during adolescence, and continue into adulthood, although individuals may not come to 
clinical attention until later in life. Caution should be exercised in applying the diagnosis 
to children because their personalities are still developing.
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Overt behavioural manifestations of certain traits (dissociality, disinhibition) tend to 
decline over the course of adulthood. Other traits (detachment, anankastia) are less likely 
to do so. In both cases, functional impairment in broad areas of life (e.g. employment, 
interpersonal relationships) among people with personality disorder is often persistent.
•	 Personality disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but may change such that 
a person who had personality disorder during young adulthood no longer meets the 
diagnostic requirements by middle age.
•	 Much less commonly, a person who earlier did not have a diagnosable personality disorder 
develops one later in life. Emergence of personality disorder in older adults may be related 
to the loss of social support that had previously helped to compensate for personality 
disturbance.
•	 When there is a change in personality during middle adulthood or later in life, in the 
absence of change in the individual’s environment, the possibility that the change is due to 
an underlying medical condition (e.g. secondary personality change) or to an unrecognized 
disorder due to substance use should be considered.
Developmental presentations
•	 Personality disorder is not typically diagnosed in pre-adolescent children. Over the course 
of their development, children integrate knowledge and experience about themselves and 
other people into a coherent identity and sense of self, as well as into individual styles 
of interacting with others. Different children vary substantially in the rate at which this 
integration occurs, and there is also substantial variation in the rate of integration within 
individuals over time. Therefore, it is very difficult to determine whether a pre-adolescent 
child exhibits problems in functioning in aspects of the self, such as identity, self-worth, 
accuracy of self-view or self-direction, because these functions are not fully developed 
in children. This is also true of interpersonal functions such as the ability to understand 
others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships.
•	 However, prominent maladaptive traits may be observable in pre-adolescent children 
and may be precursors to personality disorder in adolescence and adulthood. For 
example, individual differences in negative affectivity and disinhibition, as well as more 
specific features such as lack of empathy (an aspect of dissociality) and perfectionism (an 
aspect of anankastia) may be observed in very young children. However, such traits are 
also associated with the development of other mental disorders (e.g. mood disorders, 
anxiety and fear-related disorders) and should not be interpreted as childhood forms of 
personality disorder.
•	 Features of personality disorder manifest in similar ways in adolescents and in adults. 
However, in evaluating adolescents, it is important to consider the developmental 
typicality of the relevant behaviour patterns. For example, risk-taking behaviour, self-
harm and moodiness are more common during adolescence than during adulthood. 
Therefore, thresholds for evaluating whether such behaviour patterns are indicative of 
personality disorder or of elevations in trait domains such as disinhibition and negative 
affectivity among adolescents should be correspondingly higher. The wide variability in 
normal adolescent development that may affect the expression of these behaviours or 
characteristics should also be considered.
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Personality disorders and related traits
Culture-related features
•	 Assessment of personality across cultures is challenging, requiring knowledge of normative 
personality function for the sociocultural context, variations in cultural concepts of the self, 
and evidence for consistent traits and behaviours across time and multiple social contexts.
•	 Culture shapes modes of self-construal, social presentation and levels of insight about 
behaviours that are related to personality development, including what are considered 
normal and abnormal personality states in a given setting. For example, children reared in 
collectivist societies may develop attachment styles and traits that are viewed as dependent 
or avoidant related to the norms of more individualistic cultures. In turn, traits of self-
involvement that are accepted or positively valued in individualistic cultures may be 
considered narcissistic in collectivist cultures.
•	 Diagnosis of personality disorder must take into account the person’s cultural background. 
Collateral information may be needed to assess whether certain disruptive self-states 
and behaviours are considered culturally uncharacteristic and therefore consistent with 
personality disorder in a given culture. In general, a diagnosis of personality disorder 
should be assigned only when the symptoms exceed thresholds that are normative for the 
sociocultural context.
•	 Among ethnic minority, immigrant and refugee communities, responses to discrimination, 
social exclusion and acculturative stress may be confused with personality disorder. For 
example, suspiciousness or mistrust may be common in situations of endemic racism and 
discrimination.
•	 Sociocultural contexts of exclusion affecting marginal social groups can evoke repeated 
attempts at self-affirmation or acceptance by others that are based on ambiguous or 
troubled relationships with authority figures and limited adaptability. These reactions may 
be confounded with manifestations of borderline pattern, such as impulsivity, instability, 
affective lability, explosive/aggressive behaviour or dissociative symptoms. However, 
a diagnosis should be assigned only when the symptoms exceed thresholds that are 
normative for the sociocultural context.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Available evidence indicates that gender distribution of personality disorder is 
approximately equal. However, there are significant gender differences in the behavioural 
expression of personality disorder and in the associated trait domains. Specifically, 
elevations on dissociality and disinhibition are more common among men, and elevations 
on negative affectivity are more common among women.

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with personality difficulty
Individuals with pronounced personality characteristics that do not rise to the level of severity to 
merit a diagnosis of personality disorder may be considered to have personality difficulty if the 
characteristics affect treatment or health services. In contrast to personality disorder, personality 
difficulty is manifested only intermittently (e.g. during times of stress) or at low intensity. The 
difficulties are associated with some problems in functioning, but these are insufficiently severe 
to cause notable disruption in social, occupational and interpersonal relationships, and may be 
limited to specific relationships or situations.
Boundary with persistent mental disorders
A number of persistent and enduring mental disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, schizotypal 
disorder, dysthymic disorder, cyclothymic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder) are 
characterized by enduring disturbances in cognition, emotional experience and behaviour that 
are maladaptive, manifested across a range of personal and social situations, and are associated 
with significant problems in functioning of aspects of the self (e.g. self-esteem, self-direction) and/
or interpersonal dysfunction (e.g. ability to develop and maintain close and mutually satisfying 
relationships, ability to understand others’ perspectives and to manage conflict in relationships). 
Accordingly, individuals with these disorders may also meet the diagnostic requirements for 
personality disorder. Generally, individuals with such disorders should not be given an additional 
diagnosis of personality disorder unless additional personality features are present that contribute 
to significant problems in functioning of aspects of the self or interpersonal functioning. However, 
even in the absence of these additional features, there may be specific situations in which an 
additional diagnosis of personality disorder is warranted (e.g. entry into clinically indicated 
forms of treatment that are connected to a personality disorder diagnosis).
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions
Conduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a recurrent pattern of behaviour in which 
the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate social or cultural norms, rules or laws are 
violated; this may range in duration from a discrete period lasting a number of months to one 
that persists across the lifespan. Conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions is 
further characterized by limited or absent empathy or sensitivity to others’ feelings, and limited 
or absent remorse, shame or guilt. Conduct-dissocial disorder with limited prosocial emotions 
has features in common with personality disorder with dissociality, which is characterized by 
disregard for the rights and feelings of other, self-centredness and lack of empathy. Conduct-
dissocial disorder may be diagnosed among pre-adolescent children, based on a shorter duration 
of symptoms than personality disorder. Among individuals with conduct-dissocial disorder, an 
additional diagnosis of personality disorder is warranted only if there are personality features in 
addition to dissociality that contribute to significant impairments in functioning of aspects of the 
self or problems in interpersonal functioning.
Boundary with secondary personality change
Secondary personality change is a persistent personality disturbance that represents a change 
from the individual’s previous characteristic personality pattern that is judged to be a direct 
pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not classified under mental, behavioural 
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder

Personality disorders and related traits
Personality disorders and related traits | General diagnostic requirements for personality disorder
and neurodevelopmental disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical examination 
or laboratory findings. Personality disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are due to another 
medical condition.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Disorders due to substance use often have pervasive effects on functioning of the self and 
interpersonal functioning. For example, they may exhibit problems with self-direction and self-
esteem, difficulties and conflicts in relationships, dissocial behaviour related to obtaining or using 
drugs, and a wide range of other features that are commonly seen in individuals with personality 
disorder. If the personality disturbance is entirely accounted for by a disorder due to substance use, 
a diagnosis of personality disorder should not be given. However, if the personality disturbance is 
not entirely accounted for by the disorder due to substance use (e.g. if the personality disturbance 
preceded the onset of substance use) or if there are features of a personality disorder that are 
not accounted for by substance use (e.g. perfectionism), an additional diagnosis of personality 
disorder may be assigned.

Paraphilic disorders
Exhibitionistic disorder
Paraphilic disorders are characterized by persistent and intense patterns of atypical sexual arousal, 
manifested in sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours, in which the focus of the arousal 
pattern involves others whose age or status renders them unwilling or unable to consent (e.g. 
pre-pubertal children, an unsuspecting individual being viewed through a window, an animal). 
Paraphilic disorders may also involve other atypical sexual arousal patterns if they cause marked 
distress to the individual, or may involve significant risk of injury or death.

Paraphilic disorder, unspecified.
In order for the paraphilic disorder to be diagnosed, the individual must have acted on the arousal 
pattern, or be markedly distressed by it.
Atypical patterns of sexual arousal that do not involve actions towards others whose age or status 
renders them unwilling or unable to consent or that are not associated with marked distress or 
significant risk of injury or death are not considered to be paraphilic disorders.
Many sexual crimes involve actions or behaviours that are not associated with a sustained 
underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. Rather, these behaviours may be transient and occur 
impulsively or opportunistically, or in relation to substance use or intoxication. A diagnosis of 
a paraphilic disorder should not be assigned in such cases.
Paraphilic disorders 
Paraphilic disorders include the following:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Paraphilic disorders frequently co-occur with a number of other mental disorders, including 
mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, and disorders due to substance use. It 
is also common for an individual to meet the diagnostic requirements for more than one 
paraphilic disorder.
Paraphilic disorders may be associated with arrest and incarceration, or impairment in functioning 
(e.g. at work, in interpersonal relationships), but these are not diagnostic requirements.
Paraphilic disorders should not be diagnosed among children, and should be diagnosed only with 
the utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during adolescence, 
and sexual acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing a recurrent 
pattern of sexual arousal.
General cultural considerations for paraphilic disorders
•	 Behavioural norms, thresholds of abnormality, and attitudes and interpretations regarding 
paraphilic disorders vary across cultures. Accurate assessment requires information about 
the etiology, function and consequences of the symptoms across cultural groups.
Exhibitionistic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal – as manifested in persistent 
sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – that involves exposing one’s genitals to an 
unsuspecting person in public places, usually without inviting or intending closer contact, 
is required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges, or be markedly 
distressed by them.
Additional clinical features
•	 Exhibitionistic disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and should be diagnosed 
only with the utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during 
adolescence, and exhibitionistic acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather 
than representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.
•	 The diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder is generally not adequately supported when the 
evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists 
solely of a single or very limited number of instances of exhibitionistic behaviour, as there 
may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the 
absence of the individual’s report of their sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges indicating

Paraphilic disorders
a sustained, focused and intense pattern of exhibitionistic sexual arousal, examples 
of other forms of evidence that may support the presence of an exhibitionistic arousal 
pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms 
of sexual behaviour; or planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in 
exhibitionistic behaviour.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 By definition, exhibitionistic disorder specifically excludes consensual exhibitionistic 
behaviours that occur with the consent of the individuals involved. Moreover, in some 
cultures there are socially sanctioned forms of public nudity, which do not constitute 
exhibitionistic disorder.
Course features
•	 Individuals with exhibitionistic disorder often report the onset of exhibitionistic sexual 
interest during adolescence.
•	 Exhibitionistic disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, 
fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual who 
was previously assigned a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder no longer meets the 
diagnostic requirements.
Developmental presentations
•	 Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing 
behavioural manifestations of exhibitionistic disorder due to increased impulse control 
and decreased sexual drive.
Culture-related features
•	 Laws defining what is considered exhibitionistic behaviour may vary across cultures, 
including by gender. In addition, cultures vary regarding acceptance of the practice of 
nudity and its appropriateness in specific contexts (e.g. pornography, saunas, nudist 
settings). In these contexts, certain behaviours may not be considered exhibitionistic by 
the cultural group.

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Exhibitionistic disorder is much more common among men.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder
Both exhibitionistic disorder and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may involve repetitive 
sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result in marked distress or impairment. Exhibitionistic 
disorder is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that are manifestations of a 
sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal that involves exposing one’s genitals to 
an unsuspecting person in public places. In contrast, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is 
characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control sexual impulses, urges or behaviours, 
regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. If an individual with exhibitionistic disorder is able 
to exercise some degree of control over the behavioural expressions of the arousal pattern, an 
additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural disorder is generally not warranted.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Episodes of impulsive or disinhibited sexual behaviour, including exhibitionistic behaviour, may 
occur during substance intoxication. Such episodes may not be a manifestation of a sustained, 
focused and intense sexual arousal pattern. At the same time, some individuals with exhibitionistic 
disorder may use substances with the intention of engaging in exhibitionistic behaviour that does 
reflect an underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. A diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder may be 
assigned together with a disorder due to substance use if the diagnostic requirements for both 
are met.
Boundary with other mental disorders
The occurrence or a history of behaviours involving exposing oneself to non-consenting individuals 
is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Rather, these behaviours must 
reflect a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal. When this is not the case, other 
causes of the behaviour need to be considered. For example, exhibitionistic behaviours that do 
not reflect an underlying, persistent pattern of sexual arousal may occur in the context of some 
mental disorders, such as bipolar type I disorder during manic or mixed episodes, or dementia.
Boundary with sexual crimes that do not involve a paraphilic disorder
Sexual crimes involving exhibitionistic behaviour may consist of actions or behaviours that are 
not associated with a sustained underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. Rather, these behaviours 
may be transient and occur impulsively or opportunistically. The diagnosis of exhibitionistic 
disorder requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense 
pattern of sexual arousal.

Voyeuristic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal – as manifested in persistent 
sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – that involves observing an unsuspecting 
person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, is required 
for diagnosis.
•	 The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges, or be markedly 
distressed by them.
Additional clinical features
•	 Voyeuristic disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and is not typically 
diagnosed among adolescents. Sexual curiosity is typical during adolescence, and 
observation of others may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing 
a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.
•	 The act of observing in voyeuristic disorder is for the purpose of achieving sexual 
excitement, and does not necessarily involve an attempt to initiate sexual activity with the 
person being observed. Orgasm by masturbation may occur during the voyeuristic activity 
or later in response to memories of what the individual has seen. More recently, so-called 
“video voyeurs” have been described who use video equipment to record individuals in 
public or private places where there is an expectation of privacy.
•	 The diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is generally not adequately supported when the 
evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists solely 
of a single or very limited number of instances of voyeuristic behaviour, as there may be 
other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the absence 
of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of other forms 
of evidence supporting the presence of a voyeuristic arousal pattern include a preference

disorder is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that are manifestations of a 
sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal that involves stimuli such as observing an 
unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity. In 
contrast, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure 
to control sexual impulses, urges or behaviours, regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. If an 
individual with voyeuristic disorder is able to exercise some degree of control over the behavioural 
expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural 
disorder is generally not warranted.

Sexual crimes involving voyeuristic behaviour may consist of actions or behaviours that are not 
associated with a sustained underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. Rather, these behaviours may 
be transient and occur impulsively or opportunistically. The diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder 
requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of 
sexual arousal.

sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – involving pre-pubertal children is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges, or be markedly 
distressed by them.
•	 The diagnosis does not apply to sexual arousal and accompanying behaviour between pre- 
or post-pubertal children who are close in age.
Additional clinical features
•	 Paedophilic disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and should be diagnosed 
only with the utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during 
adolescence, and sexual acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than 
representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The diagnosis of paedophilic disorder is generally not adequately supported when the 
evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists 
solely of a single or very limited number of instances of paedophilic behaviour, as there 
may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the 
absence of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or urges, examples of 
other forms of evidence supporting the presence of a paedophilic arousal pattern include 
a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over other forms of sexual 
behaviour; planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to engage in paedophilic 
behaviour; or laboratory measures of relative viewing time (based on the finding that 
preferred sexual stimuli are gazed at longer than non-preferred sexual stimuli) and/or 
penile plethysmography.
•	 Some individuals with paedophilic disorder are attracted only to males, others only to 
females, and others to both.
•	 Some individuals act on their paedophilic urges only with family members, others only 
with people outside their immediate family, and others with both.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 A broad range of sexual behaviour with peers may occur in children or adolescents. 
A diagnosis of paedophilic disorder should not be assigned on the basis of sexual behaviours 
among pre- or post-pubertal children or adolescents with peers who are close in age.
Course features
•	 Individuals with paedophilic disorder often report the onset of paedophilic sexual interest 
during adolescence.
•	 Paedophilic disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, 
fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual who was 
assigned a diagnosis of paedophilic disorder no longer meets the diagnostic requirements.
Developmental presentations
•	 Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing 
behavioural manifestations of paedophilic disorder due to increased impulse control and 
decreased sexual drive.
Paraphilic disorders | Paedophilic disorder

Paraphilic disorders
Culture-related features
•	 Cultures vary in their legal definition of what constitutes a child or adolescent. The Tanner 
stages – a scale of physical development, including primary and secondary sexual 
characteristics across the lifespan – may provide a more objective basis than age on which 
to base a definition.
•	 Cultures vary regarding the forms of affection that are considered appropriate between 
children and adults. For example, it is normative in some cultures for parents to kiss their 
children on the mouth as a sign of affection. Culturally normative behaviour should not be 
misattributed as inappropriate sexual activity.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Paedophilic disorder is much more prevalent among men.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder
Both paedophilic disorder and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may involve repetitive 
sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result in marked distress or impairment. Paedophilic 
disorder is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that are manifestations of a 
sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal involving pre-pubertal children. 
In contrast, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of 
failure to control sexual impulses, urges or behaviours, regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. 
If an individual with paedophilic disorder is able to exercise some degree of control over the 
behavioural expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual 
behavioural disorder is generally not warranted.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive disorder
Some individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder experience intrusive thoughts and images 
about possible attraction or sexual abuse of children. These are typically highly distressing to the 
individual, and are not accompanied by sexual arousal; they therefore do not reflect an underlying 
paraphilic arousal pattern, even though the individual may be concerned that they do. These 
individuals may also experience other ego-dystonic thoughts or images with sexual content that 
are not experienced as sexually arousing.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Episodes of impulsive or disinhibited sexual behaviour, including paedophilic behaviour, may 
occur during substance intoxication. Such episodes may not be a manifestation of a sustained,

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

focused and intense sexual arousal pattern. At the same time, some individuals with paedophilic 
disorder may use substances with the intention of engaging in paedophilic behaviour that does 
reflect an underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. A diagnosis of paedophilic disorder may be 
assigned together with a disorder due to substance use if the diagnostic requirements for both 
are met.
Boundary with other mental disorders
The occurrence or a history of sexual behaviours involving pre-pubertal children is not sufficient 
to establish a diagnosis of paedophilic disorder. Rather, these behaviours must reflect a sustained, 
focused and intense pattern of paedophilic sexual arousal. When this is not the case, other causes 
of the behaviour need to be considered. For example, sexual behaviours involving children that 
do not reflect an underlying, persistent pattern of paedophilic sexual arousal may occur in the 
context of some mental disorders, such as bipolar type I disorder during manic or mixed episodes, 
or dementia.
Boundary with sexual crimes that do not involve a paraphilic disorder
Sexual crimes involving paedophilic behaviour may consist of actions or behaviours that are not 
associated with a sustained underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. Rather, these behaviours may 
be transient and occur impulsively or opportunistically. The diagnosis of paedophilic disorder 
requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of 
sexual arousal.
Boundary with sexually aggressive behaviour in adolescents
Some adolescents present with a history of sexually abusing younger children. The diagnosis of 
paedophilic disorder should be applied with caution to adolescents. Unless there is a persistent 
pattern of such behaviour, reflecting a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal 
focused on pre-pubertal children, the diagnosis of paedophilic disorder is not appropriate.
Coercive sexual sadism disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal – as manifested in persistent 
sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – that involves the infliction of physical or 
psychological suffering on a non-consenting person is required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges, or be markedly 
distressed by them.
6D33
Paraphilic disorders | Coercive sexual sadism disorder

Paraphilic disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Coercive sexual sadism disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and should 
be diagnosed only with the utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual acts may occur 
impulsively or opportunistically during adolescence rather than representing a recurrent 
pattern of sexual arousal.
•	 The diagnosis of coercive sexual sadism disorder is generally not adequately supported 
when the evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal 
consists solely of a single or very limited number of instances of coercive sadistic sexual 
behaviour, as there may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, 
opportunity). In the absence of a report of the individual’s sexual thoughts, fantasies or 
urges, examples of other forms of evidence supporting the presence of a coercive sadistic 
arousal pattern include a preference for specific types of pornography; preference over 
other forms of sexual behaviour; planning and repeatedly seeking out opportunities to 
engage in coercive sadistic sexual behaviour; or laboratory measures of relative viewing 
time (based on the finding that preferred sexual stimuli are gazed at longer than non-
preferred sexual stimuli) and/or penile plethysmography.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 By definition, coercive sexual sadism disorder specifically excludes consensual sexual 
sadism and consensual masochism.
Course features
•	 Individuals with coercive sexual sadism disorder often report the onset of coercive sadistic 
sexual interest during adolescence.
•	 Coercive sexual sadism disorder is relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual 
thoughts, fantasies, urges and behaviours may change over time, such that an individual 
who was assigned a diagnosis of coercive sexual sadism disorder no longer meets the 
diagnostic requirements.
Developmental presentations
•	 Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing 
behavioural manifestations of coercive sexual sadism disorder due to increased impulse 
control and decreased sexual drive.

Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder
Both coercive sexual sadism disorder and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder may involve 
repetitive sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result in marked distress or impairment. 
Coercive sexual sadism disorder is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that 
are manifestations of a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal that involves

compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control 
sexual impulses, urges or behaviours, regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. If an individual with 
coercive sexual sadism disorder is able to exercise some degree of control over the behavioural 
expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural 
disorder is generally not warranted.
Boundary with conduct-dissocial disorder
Conduct-dissocial disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation 
of the rights of others. Coercive or sadistic sexual behaviours that occur in the context of conduct-
dissocial disorder but that do not reflect an underlying, persistent pattern of sexual arousal 
involving the infliction of physical or psychological suffering should not be used as a basis for 
diagnosing coercive sexual sadism disorder.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Episodes of impulsive or disinhibited sexual behaviour, including coercive sexual behaviour, may 
occur during substance intoxication. Such episodes may not be a manifestation of a sustained, 
focused and intense sexual arousal pattern. At the same time, some individuals with coercive 
sexual sadism disorder may use substances with the intention of engaging in coercive sexual 
behaviour that does reflect an underlying paraphilic arousal pattern. A diagnosis of coercive 
sexual sadism disorder may be assigned together with a disorder due to substance use if the 
diagnostic requirements for both are met.
Boundary with other mental disorders
The occurrence or a history of sexual behaviours involving the infliction of physical or 
psychological suffering on non-consenting individuals is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis 
of coercive sexual sadism disorder. Rather, these behaviours must reflect a sustained, focused 
and intense pattern of coercive sexual sadistic arousal. When this is not the case, other causes 
of the behaviour need to be considered. For example, coercive sexual behaviour may occur in 
the context of some mental disorders, such as a bipolar type I disorder during manic or mixed 
episodes, or dementia.

may be transient and occur impulsively or opportunistically. The diagnosis of coercive sexual 
sadism disorder requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and

Frotteuristic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 A sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal – as manifested in persistent 
sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – that involves touching or rubbing against 
a non-consenting person is required for diagnosis.
•	 The individual must have acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges, or be markedly 
distressed by them.
Additional clinical features
•	 Frotteuristic disorder should not be diagnosed among children, and should be diagnosed 
only with the utmost caution among adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during 
adolescence, and sexual acts may occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than 
representing a recurrent pattern of sexual arousal.
•	 The diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder is generally not adequately supported when the 
evidence indicating a sustained, focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal consists 
solely of a single or very limited number of instances of frotteuristic behaviour, as there 
may be other explanations for specific occurrences (e.g. intoxication, opportunity). In the

expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavioural 
disorder is generally not warranted.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Episodes of sexual behaviour involving others whose age or status renders them unwilling 
or unable to consent may occur during substance intoxication. Such episodes may not be a 
manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense sexual arousal pattern. At the same time, some 
individuals with paraphilic disorders may use substances with the intention of engaging in sexual

Paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individuals
Essential (required) features
•	 A sustained, focused and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal – as manifested in 
sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges or behaviours – that involves consenting adults or solitary 
behaviour is required for diagnosis.
•	 One of the following two elements must be present.
•	 The individual is markedly distressed by the nature of the arousal pattern and the distress 
is not simply a consequence of rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by 
others.
•	 The nature of the paraphilic behaviour involves significant risk of injury or death either to 
the individual (e.g. asphyxophilia or achieving sexual arousal by restriction of breathing) 
or to the individual’s partner (e.g. consensual sadism that results in injuries requiring 
medical attention).
•	 If the diagnosis is assigned based on significant risk of injury or death, this risk should be 
directly and immediately connected to the paraphilic behaviour. For example, a presumed 
risk of increased exposure to sexually transmitted infections is not a sufficient basis for 
assigning this diagnosis.
Additional clinical features
•	 Paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals should not be 
diagnosed among children, and should be diagnosed only with the utmost caution among 
adolescents. Sexual experimentation is typical during adolescence, and sexual acts may 
occur impulsively or opportunistically rather than representing a recurrent pattern of 
sexual arousal.
•	 Diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals 
generally requires a report of sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges and behaviours directly from 
the individual in order to document a sustained, focused and intense pattern of atypical 
sexual arousal, and the degree and sources of related distress.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 The fact that an individual’s pattern of sexual arousal deviates from social or cultural norms 
is not a basis for assigning a diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour 
or consenting individuals. An arousal pattern that involves consenting adults or solitary 
behaviour, and that is not associated with marked distress that is not simply a consequence 
6D36
Paraphilic disorders | Paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals 

Paraphilic disorders
of rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by others or with a significant risk of 
injury or death, is not considered a disorder.
•	 The occurrence or a history of atypical sexual behaviours is not sufficient to establish a 
diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals. 
Some atypical sexual behaviours may occur impulsively or opportunistically, or as a means 
of personal and sexual exploration, and are not associated with a sustained underlying 
arousal pattern. The diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or 
consenting individuals requires these behaviours to be a manifestation of a sustained, 
focused and intense pattern of paraphilic sexual arousal, in addition to distress or 
significant risk of injury or death.
•	 When distress related to an arousal pattern involving consenting adults or solitary 
behaviour is entirely attributable to rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by 
others (e.g. a partner, family, society), a diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary 
behaviour or consenting individuals should not be assigned. Instead, categories from the 
grouping QA15 Counselling related to sexuality in Chapter 24 on factors influencing 
health status or contact with health services may be considered.
•	 This diagnosis should not be applied to individuals who are distressed about homosexual 
or bisexual sexual orientation. If an individual is presenting for treatment based on such 
distress, categories from the grouping QA15 Counselling related to sexuality in Chapter 24 
on factors influencing health status or contact with health services may be considered. If 
the pattern of distress-related symptoms meets the diagnostic requirements for another 
mental disorder (e.g. adjustment disorder, a depressive disorder, an anxiety or fear-related 
disorder), that diagnosis should be assigned.
Course features
•	 Individuals with paraphilic arousal patterns involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individuals often report the onset of paraphilic sexual interest during adolescence.
•	 Paraphilic arousal patterns are relatively stable after young adulthood, but sexual thoughts, 
fantasies, urges and behaviours, as well as any associated distress, may change over time, 
such that an individual who was assigned a diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder involving 
solitary behaviour or consenting individuals no longer meets the diagnostic requirements.
Developmental presentations
•	 Advancing age may be associated with decreasing paraphilic sexual arousal and decreasing 
related behavioural manifestations due to increased impulse control and decreased sexual 
drive.

Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Paraphilic arousal patterns involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals are 
much more prevalent among men.
•	 Paraphilic arousal patterns involving masochism are more prevalent among women than 
other paraphilic arousal patterns. If other diagnostic requirements are met (e.g. marked 
distress or significant risk of injury or death), a masochistic paraphilic arousal pattern may 
be a part of the basis for diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or 
consenting individuals.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder
Both paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals and compulsive 
sexual behaviour disorder may involve repetitive sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that result 
in marked distress or impairment. Paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individuals is characterized by sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that are manifestations of 
a sustained, focused and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal that is associated with either 
marked distress or significant risk of injury or death. In contrast, compulsive sexual behaviour 
disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control sexual impulses, urges or 
behaviours, regardless of the focus of sexual arousal. If an individual with paraphilic disorder 
involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals is able to exercise some degree of control 
over the behavioural expressions of the arousal pattern, an additional diagnosis of compulsive 
sexual behavioural disorder is generally not warranted.
Boundary with disorders due to substance use
Episodes of sexual behaviour that are atypical for the individual may occur during substance 
intoxication. Such episodes may not be a manifestation of a sustained, focused and intense sexual 
arousal pattern. At the same time, some individuals with paraphilic disorders may use substances 
with the intention of engaging atypical sexual behaviour that does reflect an underlying paraphilic 
arousal pattern. A diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individuals may be assigned together with a disorder due to substance use if the diagnostic 
requirements for both are met.
Boundary with other mental disorders in the context of rejection or feared rejection
If distress related to rejection or feared rejection of the arousal pattern by others has reached a 
point that presenting symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for another mental disorder 
(e.g. adjustment disorder, a depressive disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder), that diagnosis 
should be assigned rather than paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individuals.

Paraphilic disorders
Boundary with other mental disorders in the context of sexual behaviours that are 
atypical for the individual
Sexual behaviours that are atypical for the individual that do not reflect an underlying, persistent 
pattern of sexual arousal may occur in the context of some mental disorders, such as bipolar type 
I disorder during manic or mixed episodes, or dementia. If the sexual behaviours involved do 
not reflect an underlying, persistent pattern of sexual arousal, a diagnosis of paraphilic disorder 
involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals should not be assigned.
Boundary with gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood
Individuals who have a focused and intense pattern of sexual arousal involving cross-dressing 
might qualify for the diagnosis of paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting 
individuals if they are markedly distressed by having this pattern of arousal. A history of sexual 
excitement in association with cross-dressing can sometimes be a feature of gender incongruence 
that develops in adolescence or adulthood, but such a history is not a sufficient basis for diagnosing 
paraphilic disorder involving solitary behaviour or consenting individuals.

Factitious disorders
Factitious disorder imposed on self
Factitious disorders are characterized by feigning, falsifying or intentionally inducing or 
aggravating medical, psychological or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury in oneself 
or in another person associated with identified deception. A pre-existing disorder or disease 
may be present, but the individual intentionally aggravates existing symptoms or falsifies or 
induces additional symptoms. Individuals with factitious disorders seek treatment or otherwise 
present themselves or another person as ill, injured or impaired based on the feigned, falsified 
or self-induced signs, symptoms or injuries. The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by 
obvious external rewards or incentives (e.g. obtaining disability payments or evading criminal 
prosecution). This is in contrast to malingering, in which clear external rewards or incentives 
motivate the behaviour.

Factitious disorders | Factitious disorder imposed on self
Factitious disorders include:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Examples of behaviours involved in factitious disorder imposed on self include falsely 
reporting or simulating episodes of neurological or mental symptoms (e.g. seizures, 
hearing voices); manipulating laboratory tests to falsely indicate an abnormality (e.g. 
adding sugar to urine); falsifying past or current medical records to indicate an illness; 
ingesting a substance (e.g. warfarin) to produce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; 
and physically injuring or intentionally inducing illness in oneself (e.g. intentional exposure 
to infectious or toxic agents).
•	 The simulation of illness, injury or impairment and the insistence and intensity of its 
presentation may be so convincing and persistent that repeated investigations or even 
surgeries are performed, sometimes at many different hospitals or clinics, in spite of 
repeated negative or inconclusive findings.
•	 The motivation for the behaviour is presumed to be psychological. Factitious disorder 
imposed on self can be understood as a disorder of illness behaviour and adoption of the 
sick role. Seeking attention, especially from health-care providers as a part of the sick role, 
often appears to be a motivation for the behaviour.
•	 There is evidence that factitious disorder imposed on self in adulthood may be associated 
with being the victim of factitious disorder imposed on another in childhood.
Boundary normality (threshold)
•	 Some individuals with medical conditions may exaggerate their symptoms in order to gain 
more attention from medical professionals, family members or the community, or to gain 
access to additional treatment. A diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on self should 
only be considered if there is evidence that the person is feigning, falsifying or intentionally 
inducing or aggravating the symptoms.
Course features
•	 The typical age at identification of individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self is 
30–40 years, but at the time of first assessment it is often revealed that the disorder has 
been present without being detected for many years.
•	 There is some evidence that individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self typically 
progress from less to more extreme modes of medical deception, and from an episodic to 
a chronic pattern.
•	 Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self often do not provide accurate histories 
or access to their past medical records. As a result, systematic data regarding the onset 
and development of their factitious illness behaviour and its long-term outcomes are 
extremely limited.
Factitious disorders | Factitious disorder imposed on self

Factitious disorders
Developmental presentations
•	 Factitious disorder imposed on self can occur in adolescents, and has been identified in 
young children.
•	 Among children and adolescents, commonly reported falsified or induced conditions 
include fevers, ketoacidosis, rashes and infections. Methods of fabrication may include false 
reporting of symptoms, self-bruising, ingestion of harmful substances and self-injections.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 A substantial majority of individuals identified with factitious disorder imposed on self 
are female.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with bodily distress disorder and hypochondriasis (health 
anxiety disorder)
Individuals with bodily distress disorder or hypochondriasis may exaggerate their symptoms at 
times to ensure that their care is prioritized or taken seriously, as a part of excessive attention 
and treatment-seeking related to somatic symptoms. However, unlike factitious disorder imposed 
on self, there is no evidence that the person is feigning, falsifying or intentionally inducing or 
aggravating the symptoms.
Boundary with dissociative neurological symptom disorder
In dissociative neurological symptom disorder, symptoms (e.g. seizures, paralysis) are presented 
that are not consistent with neurological findings or other pathophysiology. In contrast to 
factitious disorder imposed on self, however, individuals with dissociative neurological symptom 
disorder do not feign, falsify or intentionally induce their symptoms.
Boundary with malingering
In malingering, individuals also deceptively report, feign or induce symptoms in order to falsify 
or exaggerate the severity of an illness. However, in malingering, primary external incentives are 
considered to be motivating the behaviour. The most common external motives for malingering 
include evading criminal prosecution, obtaining psychoactive medications (e.g. opioids), avoiding 
military conscription or dangerous military duty, and attempting to obtain sickness or disability 
benefits or improvements in living conditions such as housing. Malingering is not considered 
a mental disorder and is classified in Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact 
with health services. In factitious disorder imposed on self, the deceptive behaviour is not solely 
motivated by obvious external incentives.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with other forms of self-injurious behaviour
Individuals who exhibit self-injurious behaviour, often in the context of another mental disorder, 
may intentionally provide false information to examiners regarding either the self-induced 
nature of the injuries or the presence of suicidal ideation or intent. The deception in these cases is 
typically intended to minimize rather than exaggerate the extent to which the individual is viewed 
as ill, injured or impaired.
Factitious disorder imposed on another
Essential (required) features
•	 The presentation is characterized by feigning, falsifying or intentionally inducing medical, 
psychological or behavioural signs and symptoms or injury in another person – most 
commonly a child dependent – associated with identified deception. If a pre-existing 
disorder or disease is present in the other person, the individual intentionally exaggerates 
or aggravates existing symptoms, or falsifies or induces additional symptoms.
•	 The individual seeks treatment for the other person or otherwise presents them as ill, 
injured or impaired based on the feigned, falsified or induced signs, symptoms or injuries.
•	 The deceptive behaviour is not solely motivated by obvious external rewards or incentives 
(e.g. obtaining disability payments or avoiding criminal prosecution for child or elder 
abuse).
•	 The behaviour is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder).
Note: the diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another is assigned to the individual who 
is feigning, falsifying or inducing the symptoms in another person, not to the person who is 
presented as having the symptoms. Occasionally, the individual induces or falsifies symptoms in 
a pet rather than in another person.
Additional clinical features
•	 The range of behaviours involved in factitious disorder imposed on another is similar to 
those in factitious disorder imposed on self, and includes reporting episodes of neurological 
or mental symptoms in the other person; manipulating laboratory tests to falsely indicate 
an abnormality (e.g. adding sugar to urine); falsifying past or current medical records 
to indicate an illness; administering a substance (e.g. warfarin) to produce an abnormal 
laboratory result or illness; and physically injuring or intentionally inducing illness in the 
other person (e.g. intentional exposure to infectious or toxic agents).
•	 The simulation or induction of illness or injury in factitious disorder imposed on another 
may be quite dramatic, resulting in numerous medical investigations and interventions in 
spite of negative or inconclusive findings.
•	 The person presented as ill, injured or impaired would in many cases be considered to be 
a victim of physical or psychological maltreatment (i.e. abuse), which should be classified 
6D51
Factitious disorders | Factitious disorder imposed on another

Factitious disorders
separately using the appropriate code from Chapter 23 on external causes of morbidity 
or mortality.
•	 There is evidence that a significant proportion of perpetrators of factitious disorder 
imposed on another have a history of factitious disorder imposed on self.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Some individuals whose loved ones have medical conditions may exaggerate the reports 
of symptoms to medical professionals in order to get their loved one’s care prioritized, 
or to access additional treatments they perceive as necessary or potentially beneficial. 
Factitious disorder imposed on another should only be considered if there is evidence that 
the person is feigning, falsifying or intentionally inducing or aggravating the symptoms of 
the other person.
 Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 The most common presentation of factitious disorder imposed on another is a mother who 
fabricates symptoms in one or more of her children.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with motivated deception related to physical abuse
Caregivers who lie about the cause of abuse injuries in their dependents (e.g. claiming that an 
injury was the result of an “accident” rather than child or elder abuse) solely in order to avoid 
criminal prosecution or the intervention of child protective services should not be diagnosed with 
factitious disorder imposed on another. The diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another 
requires a clinical judgement that there are additional motivations for the deceptive behaviour, 
such as obtaining the attention and admiration of health-care providers.
Boundary with mental disorders with psychotic symptoms
Individuals with other mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and other primary psychotic 
disorders, mood disorders) may sometimes harm others, including their children, in response 
to a command hallucination or a delusion, or as part of a suicide attempt. In such cases, there 
is typically no evidence of deception associated with the harmful behaviour other than to 
avoid criminal prosecution for child abuse or other intervention (e.g. removal of a child by 
protective services).

Neurocognitive disorders
Neurocognitive disorders
Delirium
Neurocognitive disorders are characterized by primary clinical deficits in neurocognitive 
functioning that are acquired rather than developmental. Neurocognitive functioning specifically 
refers to neurologically based cognitive skills and abilities believed to be directly related to 
brain functioning, including but not limited to attention/concentration, memory, language, 
visual spatial/perceptual skills, processing speed and executive functioning (e.g. problem 
solving, judgement).
Neurocognitive disorders represent a decline from a previously attained level of functioning. This 
grouping does not include disorders characterized by deficits in neurocognitive functioning that 
are present from birth or that typically arise during the developmental period, which are classified 
in the grouping of neurodevelopmental disorders. Although cognitive deficits are present in many 
mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorders), only disorders whose core features are 
neurocognitive are included in the neurocognitive disorders grouping.

Additional categories for specific symptoms are provided in the grouping MB21 Symptoms, signs 
or clinical findings involving cognition in Chapter 21 on symptoms, signs or clinical findings, 
not elsewhere classified. These may be used to provide additional detail regarding a particular 
presentation or to describe more transient symptoms (e.g. symptoms that are closely tied to an 
underlying medical condition that are not a specific focus of intervention).
In cases where the underlying pathology and etiology for neurocognitive disorders can be 
determined, the diagnosis corresponding to the identified etiology should also be assigned.
General cultural considerations for neurocognitive disorders
•	 Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic 
factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of 
daily living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for when 
possible, as in the following examples.
•	 Test performance may be affected by cultural biases (e.g. references in test items to 
terminology or objects not common to a culture) and limitations of translation and 
adaptation.
•	 In evaluating functioning in important everyday skills, the expectations of the individual’s 
culture and social environment should be considered.
•	 Similarly, when determining the presence of perceived or observed cognitive change, 
it is important to consider cultural variations that may exist regarding expectations or 
tolerance for cognitive change. For example, some degree of memory loss or cognitive 
impairment might be seen as normal in some family or social systems, and may not be 
fully recognized when existing support systems are available to compensate.

•	 Linguistic and cultural proficiency must also be considered when interpreting test results, 
in terms of both whether the individual understood the instructions and the impact on 
test performance.
•	 When standardized testing is utilized for determination of neurocognitive impairment, it 
should be appropriately developed and normed for the population of which the individual 
being tested is a member. Where appropriately normed and standardized tests are not 
available, assessment of the essential features of these disorders requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement based on appropriate evidence and other quantified clinical assessment.
General considerations related to sex and/or gender for 
neurocognitive disorders
•	 Performance on clinical assessment or standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing 
may differ according to sex and/or gender-related factors. When clinical assessment 
or standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing is utilized for determination of 
memory or other neurocognitive impairment, sex and/or gender-related factors should be 
considered and accounted for when possible.
Delirium
Delirium includes the following subcategories:
6D70.0 Delirium due to disease classified elsewhere
6D70.1 Delirium due to psychoactive substances, including medications
6D70.2 Delirium due to multiple etiological factors
6D70.Y Delirium, other specified cause
6D70.Z Delirium, unknown or unspecified cause.
General diagnostic requirements for delirium
Essential (required) features
•	 A disturbance of attention, orientation and awareness developing within a short period 
of time (e.g. within hours or days), typically presenting as significant confusion or global 
neurocognitive impairment, with transient symptoms that may fluctuate depending on the 
underlying causal condition or etiology, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The disturbance represents a change from the individual’s baseline functioning.
6D70
Neurocognitive disorders | Delirium

Neurocognitive disorders
•	 Delirium may be caused by the direct physiological effects of a medical condition not 
classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, by the direct 
physiological effects of a substance or medication – including withdrawal – or by multiple 
or unknown etiological factors.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by a pre-existing or evolving neurocognitive 
disorder (e.g. amnestic disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia) or by another 
mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood 
disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, a dissociative disorder).
•	 When a substance or medication is present, the symptoms are in excess of those typical of 
substance intoxication or substance withdrawal for that substance, although delirium can 
occur as a complication of intoxication or withdrawal states (see 6D70.1 Delirium due to 
psychoactive substances, including medications, below).
Additional clinical features
•	 In delirium, cognition is typically impaired in a global manner, such that multiple areas of 
neurocognitive functioning are impaired upon assessment.
•	 Delirium may include impaired perception, which can manifest as illusions (i.e. 
misinterpretations of sensory inputs), delusions or hallucinations.
•	 Delirium often includes disturbance of emotion, including anxiety symptoms, depressed 
mood, irritability, fear, anger, euphoria or apathy.
•	 Behavioural symptoms may be present (e.g. agitation, restlessness, impulsivity). 
A disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, including reduced arousal of acute onset or total 
sleep loss followed by reversal of the sleep-wake cycle, may also be present.
•	 The presence of a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder can increase the risk of delirium 
and complicate its course.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Delirium is 
differentiated from age-related cognitive changes by the sudden onset of symptoms (e.g. 
within hours or days), the presence of significant confusion and/or global neurocognitive 
impairment, and the transient and typically fluctuating symptom presentation.
Course features
•	 Onset of symptoms is typically sudden (e.g. within hours or days), with a transient and/or 
fluctuating course.
•	 Symptoms are generally expected to remit with treatment of the underlying etiology or 
elimination of the causative substance from the body.
Neurocognitive disorders | Delirium

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Developmental presentations
•	 Susceptibility to delirium in infancy and childhood may be greater than in early and 
middle adulthood.
•	 In childhood, delirium may be related to febrile illnesses and certain medications 
(e.g. anticholinergics).
•	 Older individuals are especially susceptible to delirium compared with younger adults.
Culture-related features
•	 Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic 
factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of daily 
living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for when possible.
•	 When standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing is utilized for determination of 
neurocognitive impairment, performance should be measured with appropriately normed, 
standardized tests. In situations where appropriately normed and standardized tests 
are not available, assessment of neurocognitive functioning requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement. (See the section on general cultural considerations for neurocognitive 
disorders above for additional information and examples.)
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with dementia
Delirium is differentiated from other neurocognitive disorders in that the former is characterized 
by global neurocognitive impairment and confusion that have a precipitous onset, are transient, 
and fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition or etiology. Dementia is more 
typically characterized by impairment in specific neurocognitive abilities, and is often progressive 
and more gradual in onset. Individuals with dementia are at increased risk of delirium, and those 
who develop acute disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness should be assigned an 
additional diagnosis of delirium and evaluated to determine its specific etiology.
Boundary with neurocognitive impairment associated with acquired or traumatic 
brain injuries
Delirium is differentiated from an acute confusional or agitated state related to acquired or 
traumatic brain injuries by the absence of evidence of a preceding neurological injury or event 
(e.g. traumatic brain injury, cerebral haemorrhage, stroke).
Neurocognitive disorders | Delirium

Neurocognitive disorders
Boundary with transient global amnesia
Unlike delirium, transient global amnesia is characterized by the presence of isolated memory 
impairment alongside intact functioning in other cognitive areas (e.g. naming skills, self-
identification). Although both disorders may present with memory impairment, delirium 
is frequently characterized by additional symptoms, including significant confusion, global 
neurocognitive impairment, and behavioural and emotional disturbance (e.g. hallucinations, 
agitation).
Boundary with factitious disorder and malingering
In factitious disorder and malingering, the neurocognitive symptoms characteristic of delirium 
are consciously feigned. Feigned or induced symptoms may be – although they are not necessarily 
– atypical in pattern, magnitude or course, or may be medically implausible. Individuals with 
factitious disorder feign neurocognitive symptoms in order to seek attention, especially from 
health-care providers, and to assume the sick role. Malingering is characterized by intentional 
feigning of neurocognitive impairment for obvious external incentives (e.g. disability payments).
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorder
Delirium accompanied by hallucinations and/or delusions is differentiated from schizophrenia 
and other primary psychotic disorders by the absence of other characteristics of these disorders, 
and by symptoms that are transient and fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition 
or etiology.
Boundary with dissociative amnesia
Selective memory deficits are present in dissociative amnesia, and may be accompanied by 
confusion about identity if dissociative fugue is present. Dissociative amnesia is not characterized 
by disturbances in attention or awareness, general confusion or global neurocognitive impairment, 
which are features of delirium.
Delirium due to disease classified elsewhere
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for delirium are met.
•	 There is evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the 
neurocognitive disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a medical 
condition. This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing delirium.
•	 The course of the delirium (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to treatment) is 
consistent with causation by the medical condition.
Note: when delirium is due to a disease or condition classified elsewhere, the diagnostic code 
corresponding to that disease or condition should be assigned along with delirium due to 
disease classified elsewhere. If the delirium is attributed to multiple medical conditions or to a 
medical condition and a substance or medication, the category 6D70.2 Delirium due to multiple 
etiological factors should be used instead. This may include medications being used to manage 
the medical condition.

•	 Neoplasms of the brain or central nervous system
•	 Nutritional disorders (e.g. vitamin B1, B3 or B12 deficiency)
Delirium due to psychoactive substances, including medications
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for delirium are met.
•	 There is evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the 
neurocognitive disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of use of a 
substance or medication. This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The substance and the amount and duration of its use or withdrawal from the substance 
is known to be capable of producing delirium.
•	 The course of the delirium (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, eventual remission with 
elimination of the substance from the body) is consistent with causation by the substance.
•	 The duration or severity of the symptoms is substantially in excess of the characteristic 
syndrome of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal due to the specified substance.
Note: each specific substance that has been identified as contributing to the delirium should 
be classified using the appropriate substance-specific category. If one or more of the categories 
appearing below is diagnosed, a separate diagnosis of delirium due to psychoactive substances, 
including medications, should not be assigned.

substance dependence) may also be assigned.
If the delirium is attributed to a substance or medication together with one or more medical 
conditions, the category 6D70.2 Delirium due to multiple etiological factors should be used 
instead. This may include medications being used to manage the medical condition.
Delirium due to multiple etiological factors
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for delirium are met.
•	 There is evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the 
delirium is caused by either:
•	 the direct physiological consequences of multiple diseases classified elsewhere; or
•	 one or more diseases classified elsewhere and the direct effects of a substance or medication 
on the central nervous system.
•	 This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical conditions are known to be capable of producing delirium.
•	 If applicable, the amount and duration of use of the substance or withdrawal from the 
substance is known to be capable of producing delirium.
•	 If applicable, the duration or severity of the symptoms is substantially in excess of the 
characteristic syndrome of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal due to the 
specified substance.
•	 The course of the delirium (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, eventual remission with 
elimination of the substance from the body) is consistent with causation by the medical 
conditions and, if applicable, the substance.
Note: when delirium is related to one or more diseases or conditions classified elsewhere, the

•	 The delirium is presumed to be attributable to an identified cause that is not adequately 
captured by any of the other available delirium categories.
•	 This judgement depends on establishing the following:
•	 The specified cause is known to be capable of producing delirium.
•	 The course of the delirium (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to treatment) is 
consistent with the specified cause.
Note: the ICD-11 diagnosis corresponding to the presumed etiology should also be assigned.
Delirium, unknown or unspecified cause
Mild neurocognitive disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of mild impairment in one more or cognitive domains (e.g. attention, 
executive function, language, memory, perceptual-motor abilities, social cognition) 
relative to expectations for age and general premorbid level of neurocognitive functioning 
is required for diagnosis.
•	 Impairment represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning.
•	 Neurocognitive impairment is not severe enough to interfere significantly with an 
individual’s ability to perform activities related to personal, family, social, educational and/
or occupational functioning or other important functional areas.
•	 Evidence of mild neurocognitive impairment is based on:
•	 information obtained from the individual, an informant or clinical observation;
•	 objective evidence of impairment as demonstrated by standardized neuropsychological/
cognitive testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment.
•	 Neurocognitive impairment is not attributable to normal ageing.
•	 Neurocognitive impairment may be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the 
nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, use 
of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the 
etiology may be undetermined.

Neurocognitive disorders
•	 The symptoms are not better explained by another neurocognitive disorder, substance 
intoxication or substance withdrawal, or another mental disorder (e.g. attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorder, schizophrenia or 
another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, a 
dissociative disorder).
Note: cases referred to elsewhere as “mild cognitive impairment” are referred to in ICD-11 
as “mild neurocognitive disorder”. When mild neurocognitive disorder is due to a disease, 
condition or injury classified elsewhere (including disorders due to substance use), the diagnostic 
code corresponding to that disease, condition or injury should assigned in addition to mild 
neurocognitive disorder. When the etiological condition is unknown, the diagnosis 8A2Z 
Disorders with neurocognitive impairment as a major feature, unspecified, may be assigned 
in addition to mild neurocognitive disorder.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Mild neurocognitive disorder may be caused by any of the specified causes of dementia (see 
specific types of dementia, p. 621). In addition, mild neurocognitive disorder may be caused by: 
•	 anaemias or other erythrocyte disorders;
•	 certain infectious or parasitic diseases (e.g. meningitis);
•	 diseases of the circulatory system (e.g. coronary atherosclerosis);
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. cerebral palsy, epilepsy or seizures, hypertensive 
encephalopathy, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy);
•	 endocrine diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism);
•	 intracranial injury;
•	 metabolic disorders (e.g. hypo-osmolality or hyponatraemia);
•	 neoplasms of the brain or central nervous system;
•	 nutritional disorders (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency).
Additional clinical features
•	 Mild declines in complex activities may be typically present (e.g. using transportation, meal 
preparation), while basic activities of daily living (e.g. dressing, bathing) are preserved. The 
individual may engage in compensatory strategies to maintain independence in everyday 
functioning.
•	 Behavioural and psychological symptoms are commonly associated with mild 
neurocognitive disorder (e.g. depressed mood, sleep disturbance, anxiety).

•	 Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. A diagnosis 
of mild neurocognitive disorder does not apply if performance is consistent with 
expectations for the individual’s age, based on age-related norms for performance on 
standardized assessment.
Course features
•	 The course of neurocognitive impairment in mild neurocognitive disorder may be static 
or progressive, or may resolve or improve depending on the specific etiology and available 
treatment options.
•	 In some cases, mild neurocognitive disorder may represent an early presentation of an 
underlying disease of the nervous system that may later meet the diagnostic requirements 
for dementia.
Developmental presentations
•	 Mild neurocognitive disorder can occur at any point across the lifespan, with 
risk and prevalence depending on the underlying etiology. Overall risk of mild 
neurocognitive disorder increases with age because of the increased prevalence of possible 
causal conditions.
Culture-related features
•	 Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic 
factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of 
daily living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for when 
possible.
•	 When standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing is utilized for determination of 
neurocognitive impairment, performance should be measured with appropriately normed, 
standardized tests. In situations where appropriately normed and standardized tests 
are not available, assessment of neurocognitive functioning requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement. (See the section on general cultural considerations for neurocognitive 
disorders above for additional information and examples.)
Neurocognitive disorders | Mild neurocognitive disorder

Neurocognitive disorders
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with delirium
Delirium is characterized by a disturbance of attention, orientation and awareness, with transient 
symptoms that may fluctuate depending on the underlying causal condition or etiology. Delirium 
typically presents with significant confusion or global neurocognitive impairment, in contrast 
to mild neurocognitive disorder, in which there is mild impairment in one or more cognitive 
domains that does not interfere significantly with functioning.
Boundary with amnestic disorder
Amnestic disorder is characterized by prominent memory impairment relative to expectations 
for age and general premorbid level of neurocognitive functioning that is severe enough to 
result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning, in the absence of other significant neurocognitive impairment. 
While specific presentations of mild neurocognitive disorder may primarily affect memory, the 
memory impairment is not severe enough to interfere significantly with functioning in everyday 
skills and tasks.
Boundary with dementia
Dementia is characterized by marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains that is severe 
enough to cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or 
other important areas of functioning. Neurocognitive deficits in mild neurocognitive disorder 
may be in similar areas, but are not severe enough to cause significant impairment in functioning.
Boundary with mild cognitive symptoms in other mental disorders
Mild cognitive symptoms may be a characteristic or associated feature of a wide range of mental 
disorders (e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and other primary psychotic 
disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
dissociative disorders). If the neurocognitive impairment is better explained by another mental 
disorder, an additional diagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder should not be assigned.
Boundary with sleep-wake disorders
Memory and other neurocognitive impairment is frequently reported by individuals with sleep 
disturbance or sleep-wake disorders, such as insomnia and sleep apnoea. If the neurocognitive 
impairment is better explained by a sleep-wake disorder, an additional diagnosis of mild 
neurocognitive disorder should not be assigned.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Amnestic disorder
Amnestic disorder includes the following subcategories:
6D72.0 Amnestic disorder due to diseases classified elsewhere
6D72.1 Amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances, including medications
	
6D72.10 Amnestic disorder due to use of alcohol
	
6D72.11 Amnestic disorder due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or 	
	
	
anxiolytics
	
6D72.12 Amnestic disorder due to other specific psychoactive 	
	
	
substances, including medications
6D72.13 Amnestic disorder due to use of volatile inhalants
6D72.Y Amnestic disorder, other specified cause
6D72.Z Amnestic disorder, unknown or unspecified cause.
General diagnostic requirements for amnestic disorder
Essential (required) features
•	 Prominent memory impairment relative to expectations for age and general level of 
premorbid neurocognitive functioning, in the absence of other significant neurocognitive 
impairment, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The memory impairment represents a marked decline from previous levels of functioning.
•	 The memory impairment is characterized by reduced ability to acquire, learn and/or retain 
new information.
•	 Evidence of memory impairment is based on:
•	 information obtained from the individual, an informant or clinical observation;
•	 substantial impairment in memory performance as demonstrated by standardized 
neuropsychological/cognitive testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical 
assessment.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by disturbance of consciousness, altered mental 
status, transient global amnesia (i.e. memory impairment lasting no more than 48 hours, 
with most cases resolving within 6 hours), delirium, dementia, substance intoxication, 
substance withdrawal or another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary 
psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, a dissociative disorder).
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. In mild cases, if functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort (e.g. compensatory strategies).
6D72
Neurocognitive disorders | Amnestic disorder

Neurocognitive disorders
Note: when amnestic disorder is due to a disease, condition or injury classified elsewhere 
(including disorders due to substance use), the diagnostic code corresponding to that disease, 
condition or injury should assigned along with amnestic disorder. When the etiological condition 
is unknown, the diagnosis 8A2Z Disorders with neurocognitive impairment as a major feature, 
unspecified, may be assigned in addition to amnestic disorder.
Additional clinical features
•	 Amnestic disorder may or may not include the inability to recall previously learned 
information. Recent memory is typically more impaired than remote memory, and the 
ability to recall a limited amount of information immediately is usually relatively preserved.
•	 Standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing or quantified clinical assessment may 
be needed to determine the magnitude and pattern of other neurocognitive impairments, 
and to differentiate amnestic disorder from other neurocognitive disorders (e.g. dementia).
•	 Subjective reports by the affected individual of impairments in learning, memory or 
recall do not always correspond to objective or measurable impairment in these areas 
because of potential alteration in the individual’s awareness, misperceptions of abilities, 
or misattribution of the cause/source of symptoms or problems. Similarly, it is possible 
that individuals with altered awareness of deficits may not acknowledge or report memory 
impairments that are present.
•	 If standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing or quantified clinical assessment is 
not available, the symptom code MB21.1Z Amnesia, unspecified, may be used provisionally 
until a quantified assessment can be conducted.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of memory change. A diagnosis 
of amnestic disorder does not apply if performance is consistent with expectations for the 
individual’s age, based on age-related norms for performance on standardized assessment.
•	 When memory difficulties consistent with normal ageing are present and clinically 
relevant, the symptom code MB21.0 Age-associated cognitive decline may be used.
Course features
•	 Onset of symptoms can be sudden (e.g. when due to stroke or trauma) or gradual (e.g. 
when due to psychoactive substances or nutritional deficiencies).
Neurocognitive disorders | Amnestic disorder

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Symptoms may be relatively stable over time or progressive, depending on the underlying 
causal condition or etiology. In some cases, symptoms may improve over time, depending 
on the specific etiology and available treatment options.
•	 When memory impairment worsens progressively over time (e.g. due to an underlying 
disease of the nervous system), amnestic disorder may represent a prodrome for dementia.
Culture-related features
•	 Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic 
factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of
daily living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for 
when possible.
•	 When standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing is utilized for determination of 
neurocognitive impairment, performance should be measured with appropriately normed, 
standardized tests. In situations where appropriately normed and standardized tests 
are not available, assessment of neurocognitive functioning requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement. (See the section on general cultural considerations for neurocognitive 
disorders above for additional information and examples.)
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with delirium
Although delirium often includes memory impairment, it is differentiated from amnestic disorder 
by the presence of disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness, and significant confusion 
or global neurocognitive impairment, in contrast to the specific and prominent memory 
impairment seen in amnestic disorder.
Boundary with mild neurocognitive disorder
Unlike amnestic disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a mild level of 
neurocognitive decline, with little or no impairment in functioning of everyday skills and tasks. 
In mild neurocognitive disorder, symptoms are not typically restricted to memory impairment.
Boundary with dementia
Amnestic disorder is characterized by prominent memory impairment relative to expectations for 
age and general level of premorbid neurocognitive functioning, in the absence of other significant 
neurocognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia is characterized by impairment in two or more 
cognitive domains, which frequently but not always include memory.
Boundary with dissociative amnesia
Amnestic disorder is characterized by selective and prominent impairment in the ability to learn 
and remember new information, usually with relative sparing of memory for previously learned 
Neurocognitive disorders | Amnestic disorder

Neurocognitive disorders
information and past events and experiences. In contrast, dissociative amnesia is characterized by 
inability to recall important autobiographical memories – typically of recent traumatic or stressful 
events – that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting, and is often preceded by an emotional 
stressor, conflict or trauma.
Boundary with memory symptoms in other mental disorders
Memory impairment may be a presenting feature other mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, mood 
disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders). If the memory impairment is 
better explained by another mental disorder, an additional diagnosis of amnestic disorder should 
not be assigned.
Boundary with transient global amnesia
In transient global amnesia the memory impairment is temporary (i.e. lasting no longer than 
48 hours, with most cases resolving within 6 hours) whereas in amnestic disorder memory 
impairment is persistent, although in some cases it may improve with treatment, depending on 
the etiology.
Amnestic disorder due to diseases classified elsewhere
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for amnestic disorder are met.
•	 There is evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings that symptoms 
are caused by the direct physiological consequences of a medical condition (e.g. a disease 
of the nervous system, a traumatic brain injury, an infection, a tumour, another disease 
process affecting areas of the brain involved in memory). This judgement depends on 
establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing memory impairment.
•	 The course of the memory impairment (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to 
treatment) is consistent with causation by the medical condition.
Note: when amnestic disorder is due to a disease, condition or injury classified elsewhere 
(including disorders due to substance use), the diagnostic code corresponding to that disease, 
condition or injury should assigned along with amnestic disorder. When the etiological condition 
is unknown, the diagnosis 8A2Z Disorders with neurocognitive impairment as a major feature, 
unspecified, may be assigned in addition to amnestic disorder.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
•	 Anaemias or other erythrocyte disorders
•	 Certain infectious or parasitic diseases (e.g. meningitis)
•	 Diseases of the nervous system (e.g. cerebral ischaemic stroke, cerebral palsy, epilepsy or 
seizures, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy)
Neurocognitive disorders | Amnestic disorder
6D72.0

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Endocrine diseases (e.g. hypothyroidism)
•	 Intracranial injury
•	 Metabolic disorders (e.g. hypo-osmolality or hyponatraemia)
•	 Neoplasms of the brain or central nervous system
•	 Nutritional disorders (e.g. vitamin B1 or B12 deficiency)
Amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances, including medications
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for amnestic disorder are met.
•	 There is evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the 
disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of use of a substance or 
medication that persists beyond the usual duration of substance intoxication or substance 
withdrawal. This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The substance or medication and the amount and duration of its use is known to be 
capable of producing the memory disturbance.
•	 The course of the memory disturbance (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to 
treatment) is consistent with causation by the substance or medication.  
Note: if the specific substance inducing the amnestic disorder has been identified, it should be 
classified using the appropriate subcategory:
6D72.10 	
Amnestic disorder due to use of alcohol
6D72.11 	
Amnestic disorder due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics
6D72.12 	
Amnestic disorder due to other specific psychoactive substances, including 
medications
6D72.13 	
Amnestic disorder due to use of volatile inhalants.
A diagnosis corresponding to the pattern of use of the relevant psychoactive substance (e.g. 
episode of harmful psychoactive substance use, harmful pattern of psychoactive substance use, 
substance dependence) may also be assigned.
Note: the order of the categories under 6D72.1 Amnestic disorder due to psychoactive substances, 
including medications, is different from that of other parallel entities (e.g. substance-induced 
dementia, below), in which the “other specified” category is listed last. This difference is not 
meaningful; the categories should be used in the same way.
Amnestic disorder, other specified cause
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for amnestic disorder are met.
•	 The amnestic disorder is presumed to be attributable to an identified cause that is not 
adequately captured by any of the other available amnestic disorder categories.
Neurocognitive disorders | Amnestic disorder
6D72.1
6D72.Y

Neurocognitive disorders
•	 This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The specified cause is known to be capable of producing amnestic disorder.
•	 The course of the amnestic disorder (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to 
treatment) is consistent with the specified cause.
Amnestic disorder, unknown or unspecified cause

Dementia includes the following categories:
6D80 Dementia due to Alzheimer disease
6D80.0 Dementia due to Alzheimer disease with early onset
6D80.1 Dementia due to Alzheimer disease with late onset

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

This section begins by providing the general diagnostic requirements for dementia, which are 
applicable to all forms of dementia. Next, additional information is provided about the diagnostic 
requirements for each of the specific types of dementia.
Each of the dementia categories may be described as mild, moderate or severe. The general CDDR 
for dementia also provide guidance on applying each level of the severity specifier:
XS5W	
Mild
XS0T	
Moderate
XS25	
Severe
Specifiers are also provided for behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia that may 
be used when these are severe enough to represent a focus of clinical intervention. These specifiers 
are also described below as part of the general CDDR for dementia. As many behavioural or 
psychological disturbances specifiers may be applied as necessary to describe the current clinical 
picture. These specifiers may be applied to all dementia categories. They include:
6D86.0 Psychotic symptoms in dementia
6D86.1 Mood symptoms in dementia
6D86.2 Anxiety symptoms in dementia
6D86.3 Apathy in dementia
6D86.4 Agitation or aggression in dementia
6D86.5 Disinhibition in dementia
6D86.6 Wandering in dementia
6D86.Y Other specified behavioural or psychological disturbance in dementia
6D86.Z Behavioural or psychological disturbance in dementia, unspecified.
General diagnostic requirements for dementia
Essential (required) features
•	 Marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains relative to the level expected given 
the individual’s age and general premorbid level of neurocognitive functioning, which 
represents a decline from the individual’s previous level of functioning, is required for 
diagnosis.
•	 Memory impairment is present in most forms of dementia, but neurocognitive impairment 
is not restricted to memory and may be present in other cognitive domains such as 
executive functioning, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor 
speed, and visuoperceptual or visuospatial functioning.
•	 Evidence of neurocognitive impairment is based on:
•	 information obtained from the individual, an informant or clinical observation;
•	 substantial impairment in neurocognitive performance as demonstrated by standardized 
neuropsychological/cognitive testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical 
assessment.
•	 Behavioural changes (e.g. changes in personality, disinhibition, agitation, irritability) may 
also be present and, in some forms of dementia, may be the presenting symptom.
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia

Neurocognitive disorders
Additional clinical features for dementia
•	 Symptom course may provide information about the etiology of dementia (see the 
descriptions below of dementia due to specific etiologies). Most dementias are progressive 
(e.g. dementia due to Alzheimer disease, dementia due to Lewy body disease, frontotemporal 
dementia), whereas other forms are reversible (e.g. dementia related to nutritional or 
metabolic abnormalities), stable (e.g. some cases of dementia due to cerebrovascular 
disease) or rapidly progressing (e.g. dementia due to prion disease).
Boundary with normality (threshold) for dementia
•	 Normal ageing is typically associated with some degree of cognitive change. Dementia 
is differentiated from normal ageing by the severity or magnitude of neurocognitive 
impairment relative to expectations for age, and by functional impairment in everyday skills 
and tasks. Deviation from normal ageing can be determined by standardized assessment 
using appropriately normed measures. When cognitive difficulties consistent with normal 
ageing are present and clinically relevant, the symptom code MB21.0 Age-associated 
cognitive decline may be used.
Course features for dementia
•	 Onset and course of symptoms varies considerably by dementia etiology. (See additional 
information below regarding symptom onset and course for dementia due to specific 
etiologies.)
Developmental presentations for dementia
•	 Dementia in children or young adults is rare, and often caused by neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinoses, a group of lysosomal storage disorders.
•	 Dementia due to Down syndrome occurs in about 50% or more of individuals with Down 
syndrome, and typically emerges after the fourth decade of life.
•	 Risk of dementia increases in older adulthood.
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features for dementia
•	 Performance during clinical assessment may vary according to cultural and/or linguistic 
factors. When assessing impairment in neurocognitive functioning and activities of daily 
living, cultural and linguistic factors should be considered and accounted for when possible.
•	 When standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing is utilized for determination of 
neurocognitive impairment, performance should be measured with appropriately normed, 
standardized tests. In situations where appropriately normed and standardized tests are 
not available, assessment of neurocognitive functioning requires greater reliance on 
clinical judgement. (See the section on general cultural considerations for neurocognitive 
disorders above for additional information and examples.)
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential 
diagnosis) for dementia
Boundary with delirium
Delirium is differentiated from dementia in that delirium is characterized by global neurocognitive 
impairment and confusion that have a precipitous onset, are transient, and fluctuate depending 
on the underlying causal condition or etiology. Dementia is more typically characterized by 
impairment in specific cognitive skills, and is often progressive and more gradual in onset. 
Individuals with dementia are at increased risk of delirium, and those who develop acute 
disturbances in attention, orientation and awareness should be assigned an additional diagnosis 
of delirium and evaluated to determine its specific etiology.
Boundary with mild neurocognitive disorder
Dementia is characterized by marked impairment in two or more cognitive domains that is severe 
enough to cause significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or 
other important areas of functioning. Neurocognitive deficits in mild neurocognitive disorder 
may be in similar cognitive domains, but are not severe enough to cause significant impairment 
in functioning.
Boundary with amnestic disorder
Amnestic disorder is characterized by prominent memory impairment relative to expectations for 
age and general level of premorbid neurocognitive functioning, in the absence of other significant 
neurocognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia is characterized by impairment in two or more 
cognitive domains, which often but not invariably include memory.
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Disorders of intellectual development are characterized by significant limitations in both 
intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, with onset during the developmental period. 
By convention, cases that meet the diagnostic requirements for disorders of intellectual 
development are diagnosed as such unless the neurocognitive impairments are known to be caused 
by an etiology that is specifically associated with dementia, in which case the dementia diagnosis 
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia

Neurocognitive disorders
may be considered. The disorders can co-occur, and some adults with disorders of intellectual 
development are at greater and earlier risk of developing dementia. For example, individuals 
with Down syndrome who exhibit a marked decline in adaptive behaviour functioning should be 
evaluated for the emergence of dementia. In cases in which the diagnostic requirements for both 
a disorder of intellectual development and dementia are met and describe non-redundant aspects 
of the clinical presentation, both diagnoses may be assigned.
Boundary with mood disorders
Cognitive concerns and mild measurable cognitive deficits may occur in the context of mood 
disorders. These typically improve with appropriate treatment of the corresponding mood 
disorder, whereas in dementia neurocognitive impairment is not significantly affected by 
treatment of the mood disorder. Standardized assessment or quantified clinical assessment may 
be helpful in identifying the presence and objective severity of neurocognitive impairment, which 
may not correspond with an individual’s subjective cognitive complaints.
Boundary with factitious disorder and malingering
In factitious disorder and malingering, the neurocognitive symptoms characteristic of dementia 
are consciously feigned. Feigned symptoms may be – although they are not necessarily – atypical 
in pattern, magnitude or course, or may be medically implausible. Individuals with factitious 
disorder feign neurocognitive symptoms in order to seek attention, especially from health-care 
providers, and to assume the sick role. Malingering is characterized by intentional feigning of 
neurocognitive impairment for obvious external incentives (e.g. disability payments).
Boundary with neurocognitive symptoms in other mental disorders
Neurocognitive symptoms may be a characteristic or associated feature of a wide range of mental 
disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, dissociative disorders). If the neurocognitive impairment is better explained by another 
mental disorder, an additional diagnosis of dementia should not be assigned.
Specific types of dementia
Dementia due to Alzheimer disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying 8A20 Alzheimer disease, based 
on quantified clinical assessment or standardized neuropsychological/cognitive testing, 
neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family history and/or clinical history.
6D80
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Early clinical history is typically characterized by gradual onset, progressive memory 
problems and word-finding difficulties, as well as mild functional impairment. The most 
common form of Alzheimer disease begins with neuronal impairment in the medial 
temporal lobes (the brain regions involved in memory formation).
•	 As Alzheimer disease progresses and affects other brain regions, neurocognitive 
symptoms worsen.
•	 Atypical forms of Alzheimer disease are also characterized by progressive neurocognitive 
and functional impairment, with initial neurocognitive symptoms often corresponding 
to the brain region initially affected (e.g. visual processing impairment in posterior 
cortical atrophy).
Note: for all forms of dementia due to Alzheimer disease, the diagnosis 8A20 Alzheimer disease 
in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system should also be assigned.
Dementia due to Alzheimer disease with early onset
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia due to Alzheimer disease are met.
•	 Neurocognitive, functional and/or behavioural symptoms associated with Alzheimer 
disease were present prior to the age of 65 years, as evidenced by neuropsychological 
test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family history and/or 
clinical history.
Dementia due to Alzheimer disease with late onset
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia due to Alzheimer disease are met.
•	 Neurocognitive, functional and/or behavioural symptoms associated with Alzheimer 
disease were present at or after the age of 65 years, as evidenced by neuropsychological 
test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family history and/or 
clinical history.

6D80.1
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to Alzheimer disease

Neurocognitive disorders
Alzheimer disease dementia, mixed type, with cerebrovascular disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia due to Alzheimer disease are met.
•	 Neurocognitive, functional and/or behavioural symptoms of dementia appear to be 
partially related to co-existing cerebrovascular disease, as demonstrated by neuroimaging, 
medical tests and/or clinical history of cerebrovascular disease.
•	 The clinical course of neurocognitive and functional impairment is progressive, and 
typically characterized by combined impairment in so-called cortical cognitive functions 
(e.g. memory, language, visuospatial skills) and so-called subcortical cognitive functions 
(e.g. attention, processing speed, executive/frontal lobe-related functioning).
Alzheimer disease dementia, mixed type, with other nonvascular etiologies
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia due to Alzheimer disease are met.
•	 Neurocognitive, functional and/or behavioural symptoms of dementia appear to be 
partially related to a known comorbid etiology, as demonstrated by neuroimaging data, 
genetic testing, medical tests, family history, medical history and/or clinical history.
Dementia due to Alzheimer disease, onset unknown or unspecified
Dementia due to cerebrovascular disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying cerebrovascular disease, as 
demonstrated by neuroimaging, medical tests and/or clinical history of cerebrovascular 
disease.
•	 The diagnostic requirements for Alzheimer disease dementia, mixed type, with 
cerebrovascular disease are not met.

6D80.2

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Neurocognitive symptoms often follow cerebrovascular compromise. In stroke, the type 
of neurocognitive impairment varies depending on the brain region in which the stroke 
occurred. Stroke-related neurocognitive impairment typically begins abruptly after a stroke. 
Improvement in initial neurocognitive deficits is typically seen, with recovery reaching a 
plateau over time. Residual neurocognitive deficits often remain chronic over time.
•	 In contrast, in microvascular events, neurocognitive impairment typically affects so-
called subcortical neurocognitive functions (e.g. attention, processing speed, executive/
frontal lobe-related functions). If microvascular events are attributed to progressing 
chronic conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes), as is common, the clinical course of 
neurocognitive impairment may be slowly progressive.
Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the Cerebrovascular diseases grouping in Chapter 8 on 
diseases of the nervous system should also be assigned.
Dementia due to Lewy body disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying Lewy body disease, as demonstrated 
by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family 
history and/or clinical history.
•	 Clinical history involves the presence of two or more of the following symptoms:
•	 recurrent visual hallucinations (typically well-formed)
•	 episodic confusion
•	 REM sleep behaviour disorder
•	 one or more features of parkinsonism (e.g. resting tremor).
Additional clinical features
•	 Neurocognitive symptoms are progressive, and often involve relatively greater impairment 
in visuospatial skills, attention and executive functioning (as opposed to primary memory 
impairment, as seen in Alzheimer disease).
•	 Additional clinical features may include repeated falls, syncope, hallucinations in other 
sensory modalities, delusions and autonomic dysfunction (e.g. constipation, urinary 
incontinence).
Note: a diagnosis of 8A22 Lewy body disease in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system 
should also be assigned.
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease
6D82

Neurocognitive disorders
Frontotemporal dementia
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying frontotemporal disease or atrophy, 
as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, 
medical tests, family history and/or clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 Frontotemporal dementia variants include primary progressive aphasia (logopenic, 
semantic and agrammatic subtypes), behavioural frontotemporal dementia and motoric 
frontotemporal dementia (corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
•	 Frontotemporal dementia is progressive, with variants identified based on initial symptoms.
•	 Frontotemporal dementia, behavioural variant, is characterized by personality changes, 
often including apathy and progressively inappropriate social behaviour. Neurocognitive 
functioning may be preserved in the early stages, though the progression may later involve 
deficits in executive functioning (e.g. planning, problem solving), with comparatively 
intact memory skills.
•	 Frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, is characterized by 
progressive impairment in language skills, initially in the absence of impairment in other 
cognitive skills. Subtypes of primary progressive aphasia are often determined based on 
neuropsychological/cognitive testing, clinical presentation and sometimes neuroimaging, 
and are characterized by primary deficits in word finding (logopenic subtype), word 
meaning (semantic subtype) or word production (agrammatic subtype).
•	 Frontotemporal dementia, motoric variant, involves progressive impairment in 
motor functioning, sometimes in the context of progressive neurocognitive impairment 
(typically characterized by impairment in attention, executive functioning and 
visuospatial skills, with comparatively intact memory skills). Frontotemporal dementia, 
motoric variant, can include progressive supranuclear palsy (e.g. poor balance, frequent 
falls, visual impairment from gaze palsy), corticobasal degeneration (e.g. limb apraxia, 
tripping, rigidity, dystonia) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (e.g. muscle weakness, 
muscle atrophy, fasciculations, spasticity).
Note: a diagnosis of 8A23 Frontotemporal lobar degeneration in Chapter 8 on diseases of the 
nervous system should also be assigned.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Dementia due to psychoactive substances, including medications
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 There is evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings that dementia 
is caused by the direct physiological consequences of use of a substance or medication that 
persists beyond the usual duration of substance intoxication or withdrawal.
•	 This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The substance or medication and the amount and duration of its use is known to be 
capable of producing dementia.
•	 The course of the dementia (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to treatment) 
is consistent with that caused by the substance or medication.
Note: specific substances are known to be capable of producing dementia. If the specific substance 
inducing the dementia has been identified, the corresponding diagnostic category should be 
assigned:
6D84.0 Dementia due to use of alcohol
6D84.1 Dementia due to use of sedatives, hypnotic or anxiolytics
6D84.2 Dementia due to use of volatile inhalants
6D84.Y Dementia due to other specified psychoactive substance.

Dementia due to Parkinson disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying Parkinson disease, as demonstrated 
by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests, family history and/or 
clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to Parkinson disease develops among individuals with idiopathic Parkinson 
disease, and is often characterized by impairment in attention, memory, executive and 
visuospatial functions.
•	 Behavioural and psychiatric symptoms such as changes in affect, apathy and hallucinations 
may also be present.
•	 Onset is insidious and typically occurs 1 year or more after the development of Parkinsonian 
motor symptoms. The course of dementia often follows that of underlying Parkinson 
disease (e.g. if Parkinson disease gradually worsens, dementia may gradually worsen).
Note: a diagnosis of 8A00.0 Parkinson disease in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system 
should also be assigned.
Dementia due to Huntington disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying Huntington disease, as demonstrated 
by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family 
history and/or clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to Huntington disease occurs as part of a widespread degeneration of 
the brain due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which is transmitted 
through autosomal dominance.
6D85.0
6D85.1
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Onset of symptoms is insidious, typically in the third and fourth decade of life, with 
gradual and slow progression.
•	 Initial symptoms typically include impairments in executive functions, with relative sparing 
of memory, prior to the onset of motor deficits (bradykinesia and chorea) characteristic of 
Huntington disease.
Note: a diagnosis of 8A01.10 Huntington disease in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system 
should also be assigned.
Dementia due to exposure to heavy metals and other toxins
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to toxic exposure to specific heavy metals, such 
as aluminium from dialysis water, lead, mercury or manganese, as demonstrated by 
neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/or clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 The characteristic neurocognitive impairments in dementia due to exposure to heavy 
metals and other toxins depend on the specific heavy metal or toxin that the individual has 
been exposed to, but can affect any cognitive domain.
•	 Onset of symptoms is related to exposure, and progression can be rapid especially with 
acute exposure.
•	 In some cases, symptoms are reversible when exposure is identified and ceases.
Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the NE61 Harmful effects of or exposure to noxious 
substances, chiefly nonmedicinal as to source, not elsewhere classified, grouping in Chapter 22 
on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes should also be assigned.
Dementia due to HIV
Essential (required) features

neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/or clinical history.
6D85.2
6D85.3
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere

Neurocognitive disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to HIV may develop during the course of confirmed HIV disease, in the 
absence of a concurrent illness or condition other than HIV infection that could explain 
the clinical features.
•	 Although a variety of patterns of neurocognitive deficits are possible, depending on where 
the HIV pathogenic processes have occurred, typically deficits follow a subcortical pattern 
with impairments in executive function, processing speed, attention and learning new 
information.
•	 The course of dementia due to HIV, varies and may involve gradual decline in functioning, 
improvement or resolution of symptoms, or fluctuation in symptoms over time.
•	 Rapid decline in neurocognitive functioning is rare, with the advent of antiretroviral 
medications.
Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the Human immunodeficiency virus disease grouping in 
Chapter 1 on certain infectious or parasitic diseases should also be assigned.
Dementia due to multiple sclerosis
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to the cerebral effects of underlying multiple 
sclerosis – a demyelinating disease – as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, 
neuroimaging data, medical tests and/or clinical history. Cognitive symptoms are not 
primarily due to associated physiological or functional effects of the underlying disease 
(e.g. fatigue, motoric limitations).
Additional clinical features
•	 Onset of symptoms is often insidious, but progression may occur in a stepwise fashion, in 
accordance with the underlying disease course.
•	 Neurocognitive impairments vary according to the location of demyelination, but 
typically include deficits in processing speed, memory, attention and aspects of executive 
functioning.
Note: a diagnosis of 8A40 Multiple sclerosis in Chapter 8 on diseases of the nervous system should 
also be assigned.

Dementia due to prion disease
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying human prion disease, as 
demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical 
tests and/or clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to prion disease is caused by a group of spongiform encephalopathies 
resulting from abnormal prion protein accumulation in the brain. These can be sporadic, 
genetic (caused by mutations in the prion protein gene) or transmissible (acquired from 
an infected individual).
•	 Onset is insidious, and progression of symptoms and impairment is rapid, often 
characterized by neurocognitive deficits, ataxia and motor symptoms (e.g. myoclonus, 
chorea or dystonia).
•	 Diagnosis is typically made on the basis of clinical presentation, brain imaging studies, 
presence of characteristic proteins in spinal fluid, EEG and/or genetic testing.
Note: an appropriate diagnosis from the Human prion diseases grouping in Chapter 8 on diseases 
of the nervous system should also be assigned.
Dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to underlying normal-pressure hydrocephalus, 
as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/
or clinical history.
6D85.5
6D85.6
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere

Neurocognitive disorders
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus results from excess accumulation of 
cerebrospinal fluid in the brain as a result of idiopathic, non-obstructive causes, but can 
also be secondary to haemorrhage, infection or inflammation.
•	 Progression is gradual but intervention (e.g. shunt) may result in improvement of 
symptoms, especially if administered early in the course of the condition.
•	 Typically, neurocognitive impairments include reduced processing speed and deficits in 
executive functioning and attention. These symptoms are also typically accompanied by 
gait abnormalities and urinary incontinence.
•	 Brain imaging to reveal ventricular volume and characterize brain displacement is often 
necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Note: a diagnosis of 8D64.04 Normal-pressure hydrocephalus in Chapter 8 on diseases of the 
nervous system should also be assigned.
Dementia due to injury to the head
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to an injury to the head, as demonstrated by 
neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, medical tests and/or clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to injury to the head is caused by damage inflicted on the tissues of the brain 
as the direct or indirect result of an external force.
•	 Trauma to the brain is known to have resulted in loss of consciousness, amnesia, 
disorientation and confusion, and/or neurological signs.
•	 The symptoms characteristic of dementia due to injury to the head arise immediately 
following the trauma or after the individual gains consciousness, and must include 
persistent cognitive impairments following any recovery of initial cognitive impairment 
that may be seen in the immediate post-injury period.
•	 Neurocognitive deficits vary depending on the specific brain areas affected and the severity 
of the injury, but can include impairments in attention, memory, executive functioning, 
personality, processing speed, social cognition and language abilities.
Note: a diagnosis of NA07 Intracranial injury or one of its subcategories in Chapter 22 on injury, 
poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes should also be assigned.

Dementia due to pellagra
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 Dementia is presumed to be attributable to pellagra, as demonstrated by neuropsychological 
test data, medical tests and/or clinical history.
Additional clinical features
•	 Dementia due to pellagra is caused by persistent lack of vitamin B3 (niacin) or tryptophan 
either in the diet or due to poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract due to disease (e.g. 
Crohn disease) or due to the effects of some medications (e.g. isoniazid).
•	 Core signs of pellagra include dermatological changes (sensitivity to sunlight, lesions, 
alopecia and oedema) and diarrhoea.
•	 With prolonged nutritional deficiency, neurocognitive symptoms that include aggression, 
motor disturbances (ataxia and restlessness), confusion and weakness may be observed.
•	 Treatment with nutritional supplementation (e.g. niacin) typically results in reversal of 
symptoms.
Note: a diagnosis of 5B5C.0 Pellagra in Chapter 5 on endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases 
should also be assigned.

6D85.9
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia due to diseases classified elsewhere

Neurocognitive disorders
plaques and tau tangles. APP gene expression is increased due to its location on chromosome 
21, which is abnormally triplicated in Down syndrome. Dementia due to Down syndrome 
may affect 50% or more of individuals with Down syndrome.
•	 Neurocognitive deficits and neuropathological features are similar to those observed in 
Alzheimer disease.
•	 Onset is typically after the fourth decade of life, and is often accompanied by a gradual 
decline in functioning.
Note: a diagnosis of LD40.0 Complete trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) in Chapter 20 on 
developmental abnormalities should also be assigned.
Dementia due to other specified disease classified elsewhere
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 The dementia is presumed to be attributable to an underlying disease of the nervous 
system, trauma, infection, tumour or other disease process affecting specific areas of the 
brain that is listed in ICD-11 but is not adequately captured by any of the other available 
dementia categories, as demonstrated by neuropsychological test data, neuroimaging data, 
genetic testing, medical tests, family history and/or clinical history.
•	 This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The specified cause is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of the impairment (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to treatment) 
is consistent with that known to be associated with the specified cause.
Note: the ICD-11 diagnosis corresponding to the presumed etiology should also be assigned.
Dementia, other specified cause
Essential (required) features
•	 All diagnostic requirements for dementia are met.
•	 The dementia is presumed to be attributable to an identified and specified underlying cause 
affecting specific areas of the brain that is not listed elsewhere in ICD-11 (and is therefore 
not classifiable using any of the other available dementia categories, including dementia 
due to other specified disease classified elsewhere), as demonstrated by neuropsychological 
test data, neuroimaging data, genetic testing, medical tests, family history and/or clinical 
history.
•	 This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The specified cause is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of the impairment (e.g. onset, trajectory of symptoms, response to treatment) 
is consistent with that known to be associated with the specified cause.

•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by disturbance of consciousness or altered 
mental status (e.g. due to seizure, traumatic brain injury, stroke or the effects of medication), 
delirium, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal or another mental disorder (e.g. 
schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, post-traumatic 
stress disorder, a dissociative disorder).
•	 The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. In mild cases, if functioning is 
maintained, it is only through significant additional effort (e.g. compensatory strategies).
Dementia, unknown or unspecified cause
Specifier for dementia severity
Severity of dementia can be rated as mild (XS5W), moderate (XS0T) or severe (XS25), according 
to the degree of neurocognitive and functional impairment, and the capacity for independence in 
activities of daily living. Severity is rated based on objective clinical examination and information 
provided by an informant who has sufficient contact with the patient, such as a family member 
or caregiver. 
To indicate severity, the code for the appropriate severity level is appended to the diagnostic code 
for the type of dementia using an ampersand (&). For example, “6D82&XS0T” is the code for 
dementia due to Lewy body disease, moderate.
Mild dementia
Individuals with mild dementia may be able to live independently, but some supervision and/
or support is often required. However, individuals with mild dementia can still take part in 
community or social activities without help, and may appear unimpaired to those who do not 
know them well. Judgement and problem solving are typically impaired, but social judgement 
may be preserved, depending on the etiology. The individual may have difficulty making complex 
decisions, making plans and/or handling finances (e.g. calculating change, paying bills).
Moderate dementia
Individuals with moderate dementia require support to function outside the home, and only 
simple household tasks are maintained. Individuals with moderate dementia have difficulties 
with basic activities of daily living, such as dressing and personal hygiene. Moderate dementia 
is often characterized by significant memory loss. Judgement and problem solving are typically 
significantly impaired, and social judgement is often compromised. The individual has increasing 
difficulty making complex or important decisions, and is often easily confused. The individual 
may have difficulty communicating with individuals outside the home without caregiver 
assistance. Socializing is increasingly difficult, as the individual may behave inappropriately (e.g. 
Neurocognitive disorders | Dementia, unknown or unspecified cause

XS0T

Neurocognitive disorders
in disinhibited or aggressive ways), with associated behaviour changes (e.g. calling out, clinging, 
wandering, disturbed sleep, hallucinations). The difficulties are often obvious to most individuals 
who have contact with the individual.
Severe dementia
Severe dementia is typically characterized by severe memory impairment, but this varies 
according to the etiology. There is often total disorientation for time and place. The individual is 
often completely unable to make judgements or solve problems. Individuals may have difficulty 
understanding what is happening around them. Individuals are fully dependent on others for 
basic personal care in activities such as for bathing, toileting and feeding. Urinary and faecal 
incontinence may emerge at this stage.
Specifiers for behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia
Behavioural and psychological disturbances are common in dementia. Examples of such 
symptoms include apathy, mood disturbances, hallucinations, delusions, irritability, agitation, 
aggression and sleep changes. Typically, these symptoms are more frequent and impairing 
in moderate and severe forms of dementia, although this varies by etiology. Behavioural and 
psychological disturbances may be present in early stages of dementia (such as in frontotemporal 
dementia), and may be more prominent than neurocognitive symptoms.
Specifiers for behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia should be used when, in 
addition to the neurocognitive and other disturbances characteristic of dementia, the current 
clinical picture includes behavioural or psychological symptoms that are severe enough to 
represent a focus of clinical intervention. As many of the following specifiers may be added to the 
dementia diagnosis as necessary to describe the relevant aspects of the current clinical picture.
Psychotic symptoms in dementia
The current clinical picture includes clinically significant delusions or hallucinations.
Mood symptoms in dementia
The current clinical picture includes clinically significant mood symptoms such as depressed 
mood, elevated mood or irritable mood.
Anxiety symptoms in dementia
The current clinical picture includes clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or worry.

Neurocognitive disorders
Other specified neurocognitive disorder
Essential (required) features
The presence of impairment in one more or cognitive domains (e.g. attention, executive function, 
language, memory, perceptual-motor abilities, social cognition) relative to the level expected 
given the individual’s age and general premorbid level of neurocognitive functioning, and that 
does not meet the diagnostic requirements for any other neurocognitive disorder, is required 
for diagnosis.
•	 The neurocognitive impairment represents a decline from the individual’s previous level 
of functioning.
•	 Evidence of neurocognitive impairment is based on information obtained from the 
individual, an informant or clinical observation, and is accompanied by objective evidence 
of impairment by quantified clinical assessment or standardized neuropsychological/
cognitive testing.
•	 Neurocognitive impairment is not attributable to normal ageing.
•	 Neurocognitive impairment may be attributable to an underlying acquired disease of the 
nervous system, a trauma, an infection or other disease process affecting the brain, use 
of specific substances or medications, nutritional deficiency or exposure to toxins, or the 
etiology may be undetermined.
•	 Neurocognitive impairment is not better accounted for by disturbance of consciousness 
or altered mental status (e.g. due to seizure, traumatic brain injury, stroke or the effects of 
medication), a neurodevelopmental disorder, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal 
or another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder, a 
mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, a dissociative disorder).
Note: when the neurocognitive impairment is due to a disease, condition or injury classified 
elsewhere (including disorders due to substance use), the diagnostic code corresponding to that 
disease, condition or injury should also be assigned. In the presence of an identified etiological 
medical condition, if the neurocognitive symptoms are of short duration (e.g. less than 1 month), 
and it is expected that with treatment of the causal medical condition the neurocognitive 
symptoms will remit, a diagnosis of secondary neurocognitive syndrome may be assigned rather 
than other specified neurocognitive disorder.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, without psychotic symptoms
Essential (required) features
•	 Onset of a syndrome involving significant mental and behavioural features occurring 
during pregnancy or the puerperium (i.e. up to about 6 weeks following delivery) is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 The syndrome does not include delusions, hallucinations or other psychotic symptoms.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).
•	 The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
Note: if the symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for a specific mental disorder (e.g. a 
mood disorder, an anxiety or fear-related disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adjustment 
disorder), that diagnosis should also be assigned. If the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic 
requirements for a specific mental disorder, the presentation can be described using codes from 
the section on mental or behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings (p. 677).
Additional clinical features
•	 This diagnosis may be assigned regardless of whether biological factors related pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium are known to be etiologically related to the syndrome.
•	 Common presentations of mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, without psychotic symptoms, include the following.
Depressive symptoms
These may include depressed mood, excessive crying; difficulty bonding with the baby; 
withdrawing from family and friends; loss of appetite or eating much more than usual; inability to 
sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much; overwhelming fatigue or loss of energy; reduced interest 
and pleasure in usually enjoyable activities, intense irritability and anger; fears of not being a good 
mother, feelings of worthlessness, shame, guilt or inadequacy; diminished ability to think clearly, 
concentrate or make decisions; thoughts of harming oneself or the baby.
Anxiety symptoms
These may include excessive worry, general apprehensiveness not restricted to any particular 
environmental stimulus, phobic responses (e.g. related to dirt or germs) and panic attacks.
Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium
6E20

Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium
Obsessions and compulsions
Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts, images or impulses/urges that are experienced 
as intrusive and unwanted, and are commonly associated with anxiety. Compulsions are repetitive 
behaviours or rituals, including repetitive mental acts, that the individual feels driven to perform 
in response to an obsession. Obsessions and compulsions typically focus on the newborn or 
unborn infant (e.g. obsessions about the baby getting hurt, contaminated or lost; compulsive 
rituals involving checking, mental rituals and seeking reassurance). Unwanted sexual obsessions 
may also be present. There may also be excessive avoidance, such as avoiding bathing or holding 
the baby, in response to the obsessions.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 This diagnosis should not be used to describe mild and transient depressive symptoms that 
do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a depressive episode, which may occur soon 
after delivery (so-called “postpartum blues” or “baby blues”).
•	 Postpartum depression may be mistaken for baby blues at first, but the signs and symptoms 
are more intense, last longer, and interfere with functioning, including the ability to care 
for the baby. If the diagnostic requirements are met for a depressive episode, a diagnosis of 
single episode depressive disorder or recurrent depressive disorder should also be assigned.
•	 Worries and fears about the baby during pregnancy and after childbirth and some degree 
of intrusive thoughts about possible harms are common, and should not be diagnosed 
as mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or the 
puerperium unless they are persistent, associated with substantial distress, and interfere 
with functioning, including the ability to care for the baby.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
•	 This diagnosis may be assigned even if the syndrome represents a recurrence or exacerbation 
of a pre-existing disorder (e.g. a mood disorder).

Mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium, with psychotic symptoms
Essential (required) features
•	 Onset of a syndrome involving significant mental and behavioural features occurring 
during pregnancy or the puerperium (i.e. up to about 6 weeks following delivery) is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 The syndrome includes psychotic symptoms (i.e. delusions, hallucinations or other 
psychotic symptoms). Depressive and/or manic mood symptoms are also typically present.
•	 The symptoms are not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. a brain tumour), 
and are not due to the effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system 
(e.g. benzodiazepines), including withdrawal effects (e.g. from stimulants).
•	 The disturbance results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, 
occupational or other important areas of functioning. If functioning is maintained, it is 
only through significant additional effort.
Note: this diagnosis may be assigned regardless of whether biological factors related to pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium are known to be etiologically related to the syndrome. If the 
symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements for a specific mental disorder (e.g. a mood disorder, 
schizophrenia or another primary psychotic disorder), that diagnosis should also be assigned. 
If the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a specific mental disorder, the 
presentation can be described using codes from the section on mental or behavioural symptoms, 
signs or clinical findings (p. 677).
Additional clinical features
•	 Psychotic symptoms in mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, 
childbirth or the puerperium most commonly occur in the context of a depressive, manic 
or mixed mood episode, in which case a diagnosis of single episode depressive disorder, 
recurrent depressive disorder or bipolar type I disorder should also be assigned.
•	 Additional symptoms may include confusion and disorientation, sleep disturbance, 
excessive energy and agitation, obsessions and compulsions, paranoid ideation and 
attempts to harm oneself or the baby.

•	 Psychotic-like symptoms or unusual subjective experiences may occur in the general 
population, but these are usually fleeting in nature and do not interfere with functioning, 
and the person is typically aware that they are illusions. Such phenomena should not be 
diagnosed as mental and behavioural disorders associated with pregnancy, childbirth or 
the puerperium.

anxiety, non-adherence to a complex treatment regimen in an individual with personality 
disorder).
•	 The factors constitute an additional health risk to the person with the disorder or disease 
classified elsewhere (e.g. binge eating in a person with diabetes).
•	 The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate 
symptoms, or otherwise necessitate medical attention (e.g. stress response causing chest 
pain in an individual with coronary heart disease or anxiety causing bronchospasm in 
an individual with asthma).
•	 The factors increase the risk of suffering, disability or death.
•	 The factors represent a focus of clinical attention.

Psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Categories describing specific types of factors
•	 The following categories may be used to describe the specific types of psychological or 
behavioural factors that adversely affect the manifestation, treatment or course of a disorder 
or disease classified in another ICD-11 chapter. Multiple categories may be assigned as 
necessary to describe the clinical presentation.
Mental disorder affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere
•	 The presence of a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder that adversely 
affects the manifestation, treatment or course of a disorder or disease classified in another 
chapter is required for diagnosis (e.g. a woman with bulimia nervosa and type 1 diabetes 
mellitus who skips insulin doses as a way to avoid weight gain that would otherwise be 
caused by her binge eating).
Psychological symptoms affecting disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere
•	 The presence of psychological symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements 
for a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder that adversely affect the 
manifestation, treatment or course of a disorder or disease classified in another chapter is 
required for diagnosis (e.g. depressive symptoms interfering with rehabilitation following 
surgery).
Personality traits or coping style affecting disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere
•	 The presence of personality traits or coping styles that do not meet the diagnostic 
requirements for a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder that adversely 
affect the manifestation, treatment or course of a disorder or disease classified in another 
chapter is required for diagnosis (e.g. pathological denial of the need for surgery in a 
patient with cancer; hostile, pressured behaviour contributing to heart disease).
Maladaptive health behaviours affecting disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere
•	 The presence of maladaptive health behaviours that adversely affect the manifestation, 
treatment or course of a disorder or disease classified in another chapter is required for 
diagnosis (e.g. overeating, lack of exercise).

Stress-related physiological response affecting disorders and diseases 
classified elsewhere
•	 The presence of stress-related physiological responses that adversely affect the 
manifestation, treatment or course of a disorder or disease classified in another chapter is 
required for diagnosis (e.g. stress-related exacerbation of ulcer, hypertension, arrhythmia 
or tension headache).
Other specified psychological or behavioural factor affecting disorders and diseases 
classified elsewhere
•	 The presence of other psychological or behavioural factors that adversely affect the 
manifestation, treatment or course of a disorder or disease classified in another chapter is 
required for diagnosis (e.g. interpersonal, cultural, or religious factors).
Psychological or behavioural factor affecting disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere, unspecified
Additional clinical features
•	 The adverse effects can range from acute, with immediate medical consequences 
(e.g. anxiety precipitating a cardiac arrhythmia), to chronic, occurring over a long period 
of time (e.g. chronic occupational stress aggravating diabetes). The adverse effects may 
be time-limited, episodic, or chronic and persistent. The disorders or diseases potentially 
affected by psychological or behavioural factors include those with clear pathophysiology 
(e.g. hypertension, HIV infection, coronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g. chronic 
fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia) and idiopathic symptoms 
(e.g. dizziness, tinnitus).
Developmental presentations
•	 Psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere 
can occur across the lifespan. Particularly with young children, collateral history from 
parents or school personnel can assist in diagnosis. Some psychological or behavioural 
factors are more prevalent at particular stages of life (e.g. body-image concerns 
in adolescents).

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Culture-related features
•	 Differences between cultures may influence psychological or behavioural factors and their 
effects on other conditions, such as linguistic and verbal communication, explanatory 
models of illness, health-care practices and delivery, provider-patient relationships, family 
and gender roles, and attitudes towards pain and death.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with adjustment disorder
Stress associated with having a medical condition can cause psychological or behavioural 
symptoms that may meet the diagnostic requirements for adjustment disorder – specifically 
preoccupation with the stressor or its consequences, including excessive worry, recurrent and 
distressing thoughts about the stressor, or constant rumination about its implications that 
results in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other 
important areas of functioning. In psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and 
diseases classified elsewhere, the causality is in the opposite direction; that is, psychological or 
behavioural factors adversely affect an existing medical condition. For example, an individual 
who, in the weeks following a heart attack, develops severe anxiety whenever they leave the 
house because they are afraid of experiencing cardiac symptoms when no help is available 
might be appropriately diagnosed as having adjustment disorder. In contrast, an individual with 
atherosclerotic heart disease who develops chest pain whenever they become anxious would be 
diagnosed with psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere. In clinical practice, however, psychological factors and a medical condition are often 
mutually exacerbating, in which case both diagnoses may be assigned if it is clinically useful to 
do so.
Boundary with hypochondriasis (health anxiety disorder)
Hypochondriasis is characterized by persistent preoccupation with or fear about the possibility of 
having one or more serious, progressive or life-threatening diseases. The focus of clinical care is 
the individual’s worry about having a disease; in most cases, no serious medical disease is present. 
In psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, 
anxiety may be a relevant psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the clinical 
concern is the adverse effects of the anxiety on the manifestations, course or treatment of the 
medical condition.
Boundary with bodily distress disorder occurring in an individual with an established 
medical condition
Bodily distress disorder occurring in an individual with an established medical condition is 
characterized by a combination of distressing bodily symptoms and a degree of attention related 
to the symptoms that is clearly excessive in relation to the nature and severity of the medical 
condition. In contrast, in psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases 
classified elsewhere, the psychological or behavioural factors themselves adversely affect the 
Psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

Psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere
manifestations, course or treatment of the medical condition. In cases where the excessive 
attention paid to the bodily symptoms does adversely affect the medical condition (e.g. repeated 
contact with medical professionals that result in medically unwarranted investigative procedures 
that have made the medical condition worse), both diagnoses may be assigned if it is clinically 
useful to do so.
Boundary with secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with 
disorders and diseases classified elsewhere
In secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere, a medical condition is judged to be causing mental or behavioural symptoms through 
a direct physiological mechanism. In contrast, in psychological or behavioural factors affecting 
disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, the psychological or behavioural factors are judged to 
affect the manifestations, course or treatment of the medical condition. In both cases, there is a 
temporal relationship between the psychological and behavioural manifestations and the medical 
condition, but the presumed causal relationship is in the opposite direction in each.
Boundary with other co-occurring mental disorders and medical conditions
Whereas co-occurrence of a mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorder and a medical 
condition may have an impact on the management of the medical condition (e.g. medications 
used in the treatment of the mental disorder interacting with medications used to treat the 
medical condition), psychological or behavioural factors affecting disorders and diseases classified 
elsewhere would only be diagnosed if the mental disorder itself is having a negative impact on the 
manifestations, course or treatment of the medical condition.
Boundary with personality difficulty
Personality difficulty refers to pronounced, longstanding personality characteristics that may 
affect treatment or health services but do not rise to the level of severity to merit a diagnosis 
of personality disorder. In personality difficulty, there are difficulties in the individual’s way 
of experiencing and thinking about the self, others and the world that may be intermittently 
manifested in maladaptive patterns of cognitive and emotional experience and expression. The 
stress associated with being diagnosed or living with a serious medical condition is one factor 
that could potentially precipitate an exacerbation of personality difficulty. The category 6E40.2 
Personality traits or coping style affecting disorders and diseases classified elsewhere, on the 
other hand, would describe the situation in which personality difficulty has an adverse effect 
on the manifestations, course or treatment of a medical condition. In clinical practice, however, 
personality difficulty and a medical condition may be mutually exacerbating, in which case both 
diagnoses may be assigned if it is clinically useful to do so.

condition not classified under mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders, based on 
evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings. The symptoms are not 
accounted for by delirium or by another mental disorder, and are not a psychologically mediated 
response to a severe medical condition (e.g. adjustment disorder or anxiety symptoms in response 
to being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness). In the absence of evidence of a physiological 
link between the medical condition and the psychological or behavioural symptoms, a diagnosis 
of a secondary mental or behavioural syndrome is typically not warranted.

Secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome
Secondary neurodevelopmental syndromes involve significant neurodevelopmental features that

that are judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition not 
classified under mental and behavioural disorders, based on evidence from the history, physical 
examination or laboratory findings. The appropriate diagnostic subcategory (see below) should 
be used depending on whether the difficulties are related to speech or language functions or to 
other areas.
Secondary speech or language syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific speech 
or language functions (e.g. errors of pronunciation, articulation or phonology), that arise 
during the developmental period and persist substantially beyond the expected age, is 
required for diagnosis.
•	 The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, based on evidence 
from history, physical examination or laboratory findings. This judgement depends on 
establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of developmental difficulties (e.g. onset, remission, response of the 
neurodevelopmental symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is 
consistent with causation by the medical condition.

•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by a primary neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. 
a developmental speech and language disorder, a disorder of intellectual development).
•	 The symptoms are a specific focus of clinical attention.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with developmental speech and language disorders
In developmental speech and language disorders (e.g. developmental speech sound disorder, 
developmental speech fluency disorder, developmental language disorder), the individual’s ability 
to understand or produce speech and language or to use language in context for the purposes 
of communication is markedly below what would be expected given the individual’s age and 
level of intellectual functioning. However, if the symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements of 
developmental speech and language disorders and are judged to be the direct pathophysiological 
consequence of a medical condition with onset during the prenatal or developmental period, a 
diagnosis of secondary speech or language syndrome should be assigned instead.
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Individuals with a disorder of intellectual development may exhibit impaired speech production. 
If speech production difficulties require separate clinical attention in the context of a disorder of 
intellectual development that is judged to be due to a medical condition, an additional diagnosis 
of a secondary speech or language syndrome may be assigned.
Boundary with selective mutism
Selective mutism is characterized by consistent selectivity in speaking, such that a child 
demonstrates adequate speech production in specific situations (typically at home), but 
predictably fails to speak in others (typically at school). Selective mutism can occur in the presence 
of secondary speech or language syndrome, and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
speech or language syndromes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. brain injury, cerebral palsy, encephalopathy, epilepsy 
or seizures, myasthenia gravis, stroke);
•	 certain infectious or parasitic diseases (e.g. encephalitis, meningitis);
•	 developmental anomalies (e.g. Joubert syndrome, cleft palate, deafness);
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. brain injury, 
concussion, traumatic haemorrhage).
Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Other specified secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome
Essential (required) features
Note: presentations that meet the diagnostic requirements of disorders of intellectual 
development, autism spectrum disorder or stereotyped movement disorder and are judged to be 
the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition are not diagnosed as secondary 
neurodevelopmental syndrome because, by convention, these conditions are diagnosed regardless 
of whether or not they are caused by a medical condition classified elsewhere.
•	 The presence of significant difficulties arising during the developmental period in the 
acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor coordination or social functions 
that do not fulfil the diagnostic requirements of disorders of intellectual development, 
autism spectrum disorder or stereotyped movement disorder, and that persist substantially 
beyond the expected age, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition with onset during the developmental period, based on evidence from history, 
physical examination or laboratory findings. This judgement depends on establishing 
the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of developmental difficulties (e.g. onset, remission, response of the 
neurodevelopmental symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is 
consistent with causation by the medical condition.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by a neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. a 
disorder of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder, developmental motor 
coordination disorder) or the effects of a medication or substance.
•	 The symptoms are a specific focus of clinical attention.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with dementia with onset during the developmental period
Difficulties in the acquisition or execution of specific intellectual or social functions with onset 
during the developmental period (i.e. prior to the age of 18 years) that represent a decline from 
a previous level of functioning could be diagnosed as dementia if all diagnostic requirements 
for dementia are met and the impairments are known to be caused by an etiology that is 
specifically associated with dementia. Otherwise, if the impairments are known to be due to a 
medical condition and diagnostic requirements for another neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. 
a disorder of intellectual development) are not met, a diagnosis of other specified secondary 
neurodevelopmental disorder should be considered.
6E60.Y
Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development or autism spectrum disorder
If the symptoms meet the diagnostic requirements of disorders of intellectual development 
or autism spectrum disorder and are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence 
of a medical condition with onset during the prenatal or developmental period (e.g. fragile X 
syndrome), both disorder of intellectual development or autism spectrum disorder and the 
underlying medical condition should be diagnosed, and a diagnosis of other specified secondary 
neurodevelopmental syndrome should not be assigned. However, if the diagnostic requirements 
of a disorder of intellectual development or autism spectrum disorder are not fully met (e.g. 
limitations in intellectual functioning are present without limitations in adaptive functioning), 
and the symptoms are attributed to a medical condition with onset during the prenatal or 
developmental period, a diagnosis of other specified secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome 
may be assigned.
Boundary with developmental motor coordination disorder
In developmental motor coordination disorder, individuals exhibit significant delays in the 
acquisition of gross and fine motor skills during the developmental period, and impairment in 
the execution of coordinated motor skills that manifest in clumsiness, slowness or inaccuracy of 
motor performance. If the difficulties with motor coordination are solely attributable to a disease 
of nervous system (e.g. cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy), a disease of the musculoskeletal 
system or connective tissue, a sensory impairment (especially severe visual impairment) or joint 
hypermobility, a diagnosis of other specified secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome should be 
assigned rather than developmental motor coordination disorder.
Boundary with stereotyped movement disorder
Stereotyped movement disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized bythe 
presence of persistent voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped movements (e.g. body rocking, head 
banging) that result in significant interference with the ability to engage in normal daily activities 
or result in severe bodily injury. Stereotyped movement disorder is diagnosed even if it is judged 
to be caused by a medical condition classified elsewhere, and a diagnosis of other specified 
secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome is not assigned.
Boundary with other neurodevelopmental disorders
The diagnosis of secondary neurodevelopmental disorder should be assigned instead of other 
neurodevelopmental disorders when the symptoms are judged to be due to an underlying medical 
condition. (This does not apply to disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder 
or stereotyped movement disorder.)
Boundary with developmental difficulties caused by substances or medications, 
including withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of other specified secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome, it 
is important to rule out the possibility that a medication or substance is causing difficulties in 
the acquisition or execution of specific intellectual, motor or social functions instead of – or in 
addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether any of 
the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause developmental 
difficulties at the dose and duration at which it has been administered. Second, a temporal 
relationship between the medication use and the onset of the developmental difficulties should 
be established (i.e. the developmental difficulties began after administration of the medication).
Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
long-lasting intellectual impairment, poor social functioning, learning difficulties and disruptions 
in attentional processes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. acquired epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome), 
autoimmune encephalitis, encephalopathy);
•	 developmental anomalies (e.g. Rett syndrome);
•	 diseases of the visual system (e.g. congenital blindness, vision impairment);
•	 endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hyper- or 
hypothyroidism, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, lysosomal diseases such as neuronal ceroid, 
lipofuscinosis or sphingolipidosis, mucolipidosis, phenylketonuria);
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. brain injury, 
concussion, traumatic haemorrhage);
•	 neoplasms (e.g. neoplasms of brain or meninges).
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
long-lasting movement dysfunction or motor impairment include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. cerebral palsy, Huntington disease, muscular dystrophy, 
Parkinson disease, tardive dyskinesia);
•	 developmental anomalies (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Rett syndrome);
•	 endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).
Secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome, unspecified
Secondary psychotic syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of prominent hallucinations and/or delusions is required for diagnosis.
•	 The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings. 
This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of the hallucinations and/or delusions (e.g. onset, remission, response of the 
psychotic symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with 
causation by the medical condition.

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders
Determining whether psychotic symptoms are due to a medical condition as opposed to 
manifestations of a primary mental disorder is often difficult because the clinical presentations 
may be similar. Establishing the presence of a potentially explanatory medical condition that can 
cause hallucinations or delusions and the temporal relationship between the medical condition 
and the psychotic symptoms is critical in diagnosing secondary psychotic syndrome. A list of 
medical conditions that have been reported to cause psychotic symptoms is included below 
(p. 659), but the strength of the association varies according to the medical condition. Secondary 
psychotic syndrome is often characterized by clinical features that would be atypical for a primary 
psychotic disorder such as later age of onset, rapid occurrence of clouding of consciousness, and 
accompanying cognitive, neurological or medical symptoms. In secondary psychotic syndrome, 
disorganized thinking (formal thought disorder) is not typically present, delusions are more often 
simple and fragmented, and hallucinations are more often visual, tactile, olfactory or gustatory 
rather than auditory.
Boundary with psychotic symptoms that are precipitated by the stress of being 
diagnosed with a medical condition
Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, a 
potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), being diagnosed 
with a severe medical condition can be experienced as a traumatic event, which could trigger the 
development of psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations and delusions) in susceptible individuals 
(e.g. individuals with a pre-existing psychotic disorder, a dissociative disorder or a personality 
disorder). If the psychotic symptoms are part of the presentation of a diagnosable mental disorder 
that is judged to be precipitated or exacerbated by the stress of being diagnosed or coping with a 
medical condition, the appropriate mental disorder (e.g. acute and transient psychotic disorder, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, recurrent depressive disorder) should be diagnosed rather than 
secondary psychotic syndrome.
Boundary with delirium due to disease classified elsewhere
Hallucinations or delusions can occur in the context of delirium due to disease classified elsewhere. 
Delirium is characterized by disturbed attention (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain 
and shift attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment) that develops 
over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day, accompanied by 
other cognitive impairments such as memory deficit, disorientation or impairment in language, 
visuospatial ability or perception. Disturbed attention and awareness and severe cognitive 
impairment are not features of secondary psychotic syndrome. If the psychotic symptoms are 
judged to be better explained by delirium due to disease classified elsewhere, an additional 
diagnosis of secondary psychotic syndrome is not warranted.
Boundary with dementia
Hallucinations or delusions can occur in the context of dementia, which is characterized by a 
decline from a previous level of cognitive functioning with impairment in two or more cognitive 
domains (e.g. memory, executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, 
psychomotor speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). In contrast, secondary psychotic 
syndrome is not accompanied by marked cognitive impairment. The presence of hallucinations 
or delusions in the context of dementia can be recorded using the psychotic symptoms in dementia 
specifier. If the psychotic symptoms are judged to be due to the same medical condition as is 
causing the dementia, an additional diagnosis of secondary psychotic syndrome is not warranted.
Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere
Boundary with psychotic symptoms caused by substances or medications, 
including withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of secondary psychotic syndrome, it is important to rule out the 
possibility that a medication or substance is causing the hallucinations or delusions instead of 
– or in addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether 
any of the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause psychotic 
symptoms at the dose and duration at which it has been administered. Second, a temporal 
relationship between the medication use and the onset of the psychotic symptoms should be 
established (i.e. the psychotic symptoms began after administration of the medication and/or 
remitted once the medication was discontinued). The same reasoning applies to individuals 
with a medical condition and psychotic symptoms who are also using a psychoactive substance 
known to cause hallucinations or delusions, in the context of either intoxication or withdrawal 
(e.g. visual hallucinations during sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal; paranoid delusions 
during cocaine intoxication). In such cases, if the intensity or duration of the psychotic symptoms 
is substantially in excess of psychotic-like disturbances of perception, cognition or behaviour 
that are characteristic of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal syndromes, then 
substance-induced psychotic disorder is the appropriate diagnosis, applying the appropriate 
category corresponding to the substance involved.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
psychotic syndromes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. encephalitis, encephalopathy, genetic prion disease, 
intracerebral haemorrhage, Lewy body disease, migraine, movement disorders such as 
Huntington disease or Friedreich ataxia, multiple sclerosis, seizures, stroke);
•	 certain infectious or parasitic diseases (e.g. neurosyphilis);
•	 diseases of the immune system (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus);
•	 endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. hyper- and hypoadrenalism, hyper- and 
hypoparathyroidism, hyper- and hypothyroidism, hypo-osmolality or hyponatraemia, 
hypoglycaemia, porphyrias, vitamin B1 or vitamin B12 deficiency, Wilson disease);
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. brain injury, 
concussion, traumatic haemorrhage, injury of optic or acoustic nerve);
•	 neoplasms (e.g. neoplasms of brain or meninges).
Secondary mood syndrome

can cause mood symptoms and the temporal relationship between the medical condition and

are atypical for mood disorders (e.g. atypical age of onset or course, absence of family history), 
secondary mood syndrome is more likely.

Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, a 
potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), mood 
symptoms can occur as a part of a psychological response to being diagnosed and/or having to 
cope with a severe medical condition. In the absence of evidence of a physiological link between 
the medical condition and the mood symptoms, the appropriate mental disorder (e.g. adjustment 
disorder, a mood disorder) rather than secondary mood syndrome should be diagnosed.
Boundary with delirium due to disease classified elsewhere
Mood symptoms can occur in the context of delirium due to disease classified elsewhere. 
Delirium is characterized by disturbed attention (i.e. reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain 
and shift attention) and awareness (i.e. reduced orientation to the environment) that develops 
over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of a day, accompanied by 
other cognitive impairment such as memory deficit, disorientation or impairment in language, 
visuospatial ability or perception. In contrast, mood symptoms in secondary mood syndrome 
occur in the absence of disturbed attention or severe cognitive impairment. If mood symptoms 
are judged to be better explained by delirium due to disease classified elsewhere, an additional 
diagnosis of secondary mood syndrome is not warranted.
Boundary with dementia
Mood symptoms can occur in the context of dementia, which is characterized by a decline from 
a previous level of cognitive functioning with impairment in two or more cognitive domains (e.g. 
memory, executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor 
speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). In contrast, secondary mood syndrome is not 
accompanied by marked cognitive impairment. The presence of mood symptoms in the context of 
dementia can be recorded using the mood symptoms in dementia specifier. If the mood symptoms 
are judged to be due to the same medical condition as is causing the dementia, an additional 
diagnosis of secondary mood syndrome is not warranted.

Boundary with secondary catatonia syndrome
Certain symptoms of secondary catatonia syndrome are similar to those observed during 
manic, depressive or mixed episodes (e.g. stupor or mutism in secondary catatonia is similar 
to psychomotor retardation in a depressive episode; agitation or impulsivity in secondary 
catatonia syndrome is similar to increased activity and impulsive reckless behaviour in a manic 
episode). In secondary catatonia syndrome, these symptoms occur in conjunction with other 
catatonic symptoms (e.g. abnormal psychomotor activity such as mannerisms, waxy flexibility or 
posturing), which are not characteristic of secondary mood syndrome.
Boundary with mood symptoms caused by substances or medications, including 
withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of secondary mood syndrome, it is important to rule out the 
possibility that a medication or substance is causing the mood symptoms instead of –or in 
addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether any of 
the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause depressive or 
manic symptoms (e.g. steroids or alpha-interferon) at the dose and duration at which it has been 
administered. Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use and the onset of the 
mood symptoms should be established (i.e. the mood symptoms began after administration of the 
medication and/or remitted once the medication was discontinued). The same reasoning applies 
to individuals with a medical condition and mood symptoms who are also using a psychoactive 
substance known to cause mood symptoms, in the context of either intoxication or withdrawal 
(e.g. euphoric mood due to stimulant intoxication, dysphoric mood due to cocaine withdrawal). 
In such cases, if the intensity or duration of the mood symptoms is substantially in excess of 
mood disturbances that are characteristic of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal 
syndrome, then substance-induced mood disorder is the appropriate diagnosis, applying the 
appropriate category corresponding to the substance involved.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
depressive mood syndromes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. cerebrovascular disease, Huntington disease, normal-
pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, stroke);
•	 certain infectious or parasitic diseases (candidosis, HIV disease, Lyme borreliosis, 
toxoplasmosis);
•	 diseases of the immune system (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus);
•	 endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. Cushing syndrome, hypercalcaemia, 
hyperglycaemia, hypermagnesaemia, hypoadrenalism, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency);
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. brain injury, 
concussion, traumatic haemorrhage);
•	 neoplasms (e.g. malignant neoplasm of pancreas leading to a paraneoplastic disorder of 
the nervous system, brain or spinal cord).
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
manic mood syndromes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. movement disorders such as Huntington disease, 
multiple sclerosis, seizures, stroke);

•	 diseases of the immune system (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus);
•	 endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. hyperadrenalism, hypocalcaemia, 
hypomagnesaemia, thyrotoxicosis, Wilson disease);
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. brain injury, 
concussion, traumatic haemorrhage, injury of optic or acoustic nerve);
•	 neoplasms (e.g. neoplasms of brain or meninges).
Secondary anxiety syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of prominent anxiety symptoms (e.g. excessive worry, intense fear that is out 
of proportion to actual danger, panic attacks) is required for diagnosis.
•	 The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory 
findings (as opposed to being a psychological reaction to having the medical condition). 
This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of the anxiety symptoms (e.g. onset, remission, response of the anxiety 
symptoms to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation 
by the medical condition.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by delirium, dementia, another mental 
disorder (e.g. anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, disorders specifically 
associated with stress, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders) or the effects of a 
medication or substance, including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with anxiety and fear-related disorders
Determining whether anxiety symptoms are due to a medical condition as opposed to 
manifestations of a mental disorder is often difficult because the clinical presentations may 
be similar. In some cases, the anxiety symptoms may reach the point of warranting a separate 
diagnosis of an anxiety or fear-related disorder, or a pre-existing anxiety or fear-related disorder 
may be exacerbated. Diagnosing secondary anxiety syndrome depends on establishing the 
presence of a medical condition that can cause anxiety symptoms and a temporal relationship 
between the medical condition and the anxiety symptoms. If the clinical features are atypical for 
anxiety and fear-related disorders (e.g. a new onset of unexpected panic attacks in an older adult), 
secondary anxiety syndrome is more likely.

Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type of cancer, 
a potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), anxiety 
symptoms can occur as a part of a psychological response to being diagnosed and/or having to 
cope with a severe medical condition. In the absence of evidence of a physiological link between 
the medical condition and the anxiety symptoms, a diagnosis of secondary anxiety syndrome is 
not warranted. Instead, the appropriate mental disorder can be diagnosed (e.g. an anxiety or fear-

secondary anxiety syndrome occur in the absence of disturbed attention or severe cognitive 
impairment. If the anxiety symptoms are judged to be better explained by delirium due to disease 
classified elsewhere, an additional diagnosis of secondary anxiety syndrome is not warranted.
Boundary with dementia
Anxiety symptoms can occur in the context of dementia, which is characterized by a decline from 
a previous level of cognitive functioning with impairment in two or more cognitive domains (e.g. 
memory, executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor 
speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). In contrast, secondary anxiety syndrome is not 
accompanied by marked cognitive impairment. The presence of anxiety symptoms in the context 
of dementia can be recorded using the anxiety symptoms in dementia specifier. If the anxiety 
symptoms are judged to be due to the same medical condition as is causing the dementia, an 
additional diagnosis of secondary anxiety syndrome is not warranted.

symptoms who are also using a psychoactive substance known to cause anxiety, in the context 
of either intoxication or withdrawal (e.g. panic attacks during anxiolytic or opioid withdrawal, 
physiological symptoms of excessive autonomic arousal in stimulant intoxication). In such 
cases, if the intensity or duration of the anxiety symptoms is substantially in excess of anxiety 
symptoms that are characteristic of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal syndrome, 
then substance-induced anxiety disorder is the appropriate diagnosis, applying the appropriate 
category corresponding to the substance involved.

Secondary obsessive-compulsive or related syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and

Boundary with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
Determining whether obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms are due to a medical condition 
as opposed to manifestations of a primary mental disorder is often difficult because the clinical 
presentations may be similar. Establishing the presence of a potentially explanatory medical 
condition that can cause obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms and the temporal relationship 
between the medical condition and the primary obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms is 
critical in diagnosing secondary obsessive-compulsive or related syndrome. Secondary obsessive-
compulsive or related syndrome is often characterized by clinical features that would be atypical 
for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, such as late age of onset, sudden appearance of 
symptoms, or accompanying cognitive impairment or focal neurological signs.
Boundary with obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms caused by substances 
or medications, including withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of secondary obsessive-compulsive or related syndrome, it is 
important to rule out the possibility that a medication or substance is causing the obsessive-
compulsive or related symptoms instead of – or in addition to – an underlying medical condition. 
This involves first considering whether any of the medications being used to treat the medical 
condition are known to cause obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms at the dose and duration 
at which it has been administered. Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use

obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms began after administration of the medication and/
or remitted once the medication was discontinued). The same reasoning applies to individuals 
with a medical condition and obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms who are also using 
a psychoactive substance known to cause obsessive-compulsive or related symptoms in the 
context of either intoxication or withdrawal (e.g. cocaine-induced hair pulling, obsessions or 
compulsions due to amfetamine intoxication). In such cases, a diagnosis of a substance-induced 
obsessive-compulsive or related disorder should be assigned, applying the appropriate category 
corresponding to the substance involved.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
obsessive-compulsive or related syndromes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. epilepsy, Huntington disease, myoclonic disorders,

identity) is required for diagnosis.
•	 The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory findings. 
This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the observed symptoms.

Boundary with dissociative symptoms that are precipitated by the stress of being

The stress of a medical diagnosis can precipitate dissociative symptoms (e.g. depersonalization, 
derealization). Depending on the nature of the medical condition (e.g. a life-threatening type 
of cancer, a potentially fatal infection) or its onset (e.g. a heart attack, a stroke, a severe injury), 
being diagnosed and/or having to cope with a severe medical condition can be experienced as 
a traumatic event, which may trigger dissociative symptoms. In the absence of evidence of a 
physiological link between the medical condition and the dissociative symptoms, a diagnosis of 
secondary dissociative syndrome is not warranted. Instead, the appropriate mental disorder can 
be diagnosed (e.g. adjustment disorder, depersonalization-derealization disorder).

Secondary impulse control syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of impulse control disorders

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with primary impulse control disorder or disorders due to addictive 
behaviours
Determining whether disturbances of impulse control are due to medical conditions classified 
elsewhere or are manifestations of an impulse control disorder or a disorder due to addictive 
behaviours is often difficult because the clinical presentations may be similar. Establishing the 
presence of a potentially explanatory medical condition that can cause disturbances of impulse 
control and the temporal relationship between the medical condition and the disturbances of 
impulse control is critical in diagnosing secondary impulse control syndrome. Compared to 
impulse control disorders or disorders due to addictive behaviours, secondary impulse control 
syndrome is more likely to be associated with atypical clinical features, such as a later age of onset 
or the presence of disturbances of impulse control in individuals who generally exhibit low levels 
of disinhibition or negative emotionality.
Boundary with delirium and dementia
Disturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour can occur in the context of delirium or 
dementia. Secondary impulse control syndrome is characterized by disturbances of impulse control 
or addictive behaviours (e.g. aggressive outbursts, compulsive sexual behaviour) occurring in the 
absence of severe cognitive impairment. In contrast, delirium is characterized by fluctuating levels 
of consciousness and autonomic disturbances, while dementia is characterized by severe memory 
impairment as well as impairments in other domains of cognitive functioning. Disturbances of 
impulse control or addictive behaviour in the context of dementia may be recorded using one of 
the behavioural or psychological disturbances in dementia specifiers (e.g. agitation or aggression 
in dementia, disinhibition in dementia), if applicable. If the symptoms are judged to be due to the 
same medical condition as is causing the dementia, an additional diagnosis of secondary impulse 
control syndrome is not warranted.
Boundary with secondary personality change
Disturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour can occur as part of secondary personality 
change. If the disturbances of impulse control are accompanied by other features of personality 
disturbance that are also judged to be due to a medical condition classified elsewhere, a diagnosis 
of secondary personality change should be assigned instead.
Boundary with disturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour caused by 
substances or medications, including withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of secondary impulse control syndrome, it is important to rule 
out the possibility that a medication or substance is causing the symptoms instead of – or in 
addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether any of 
the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause disturbances of 
impulse control or addictive behaviour at the dose and duration at which it has been administered 
(e.g. dopamine agonists such as pramipexole for Parkinson disease or restless legs syndrome). 
Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use and the onset of the symptoms 
should be established (i.e. the symptoms began after administration of the medication and/or 
remitted once the medication was discontinued). The same reasoning applies to individuals 
with a medical condition and disturbances of impulse control who are also using a psychoactive 
substance known to cause disturbances of impulse control or addictive behaviour, in the 
Secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and diseases classified elsewhere

context of either intoxication or withdrawal (e.g. compulsive sexual behaviour due to cocaine 
intoxication, aggressive outburst due to methamfetamine intoxication). In such cases, substance-
induced impulse control disorder is the appropriate diagnosis, applying the appropriate category 
corresponding to the substance involved.
Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
impulse control syndromes include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. encephalitis, seizures, stroke, Klüver–Bucy syndrome);
•	 developmental anomalies (e.g. male with double or multiple Y [xyy syndrome]);
•	 endocrine diseases;
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. intracranial injury);
•	 neoplasms (e.g. neoplasms of brain).
Secondary neurocognitive syndrome
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of deficits in neurocognitive functioning that do not meet the diagnostic 
requirements for delirium, mild neurocognitive disorder, amnestic disorder or dementia, 
and do not have their onset during the developmental period, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The neurocognitive symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence 
of a medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or 
laboratory findings (as opposed to being a psychological reaction to having the medical 
condition). This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of the deficits in neurocognitive functioning (e.g. onset, remission, response 
to treatment of the etiological medical condition) is consistent with causation by the 
medical condition.
•	 The symptoms are not judged to be better explained by disturbance of consciousness or 
altered mental status (e.g. due to seizure, traumatic brain injury, stroke or the effects of 
medication), a neurodevelopmental disorder, another mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia 
or another primary psychotic disorder, a mood disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
a dissociative disorder) or the effects of a medication or substance, including withdrawal 
effects.
•	 The symptoms are of short duration (e.g. less than 1 month), and it is expected that the 
neurocognitive symptoms will remit with treatment of the etiological medical condition.
•	 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with neurocognitive disorders
Delirium, mild neurocognitive disorder, amnestic disorder and dementia can all be caused by 
medical conditions classified elsewhere. If the presentation meets the diagnostic requirements for 
any of these neurocognitive disorders, that diagnosis should be assigned rather than secondary 
neurocognitive syndrome. If the presence of a specific etiological medical condition has not been 
established, a diagnosis of other specified neurocognitive disorder should be assigned.
Boundary with disorders of intellectual development
Presentations that meet the diagnostic requirements for disorder of intellectual development 
and are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition are 
not diagnosed as secondary neurocognitive syndrome because, by convention, disorders 
of intellectual development are diagnosed regardless of etiology. In these cases, disorder of 
intellectual development and the underlying medical condition should be diagnosed, and a 
diagnosis of secondary neurocognitive syndrome is not assigned.
Boundary with secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome
Secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome may also be characterized by cognitive impairment 
that is judged to be due to a medical condition. If the cognitive impairment has its onset during 
the developmental period, the appropriate diagnosis is secondary neurodevelopmental syndrome 
rather than secondary neurocognitive syndrome.
Boundary with other mental disorders that may be associated with cognitive 
impairment
Deficits in cognitive functioning may be a presenting or associated feature of a variety of mental 
disorders (e.g. developmental speech or language disorders, developmental learning disorders, 
schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorders, mood disorders). Secondary neurocognitive 
syndrome should be diagnosed only if a medical condition has been identified that is judged to 
be the direct physiological cause of the neurocognitive impairment.
Boundary with deficits in cognitive functioning caused by substances or 
medications, including withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of secondary neurocognitive syndrome, it is important to rule out 
the possibility that a medication or substance is causing the deficits in neurocognitive functioning 
instead of – or in addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering 
whether any of the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause 
deficits in cognitive functioning at the dose and duration at which it has been administered. 
Second, a temporal relationship between the medication use and the onset of the deficits in 
neurocognitive functioning should be established (i.e. deficits in neurocognitive functioning 
began after administration of the medication and/or remitted once the medication was 
discontinued). The same reasoning applies to individuals with a medical condition who are using 
a psychoactive substance known to cause deficits in neurocognitive functioning (e.g. memory 
loss due to sedative intoxication, disturbed attention/concentration and orientation due to 
alcohol intoxication). In such cases, delirium, amnestic disorder or dementia due to psychoactive 
substances (including medications) or mild neurocognitive disorder is the appropriate diagnosis, 
applying the appropriate category corresponding to the substance involved.

hypothyroidism);
•	 neoplasms (e.g. neoplasms of brain).
Secondary personality change
Essential (required) features
•	 The presence of personality disturbance (e.g. marked apathy, indifference, suspiciousness, 
paranoid ideation, disinhibition) that represents a change from the individual’s previous 
characteristic personality pattern is required for diagnosis.
•	 The personality change is judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a 
medical condition, based on evidence from the history, physical examination or laboratory 
findings. This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the observed symptoms.
•	 The course of the personality change (e.g. onset, remission, response of the personality 
disturbance to treatment of the etiological medical condition is consistent with causation 
by the medical condition).
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by delirium, dementia, another mental 
disorder (e.g. personality disorder, impulse control disorders, secondary impulse control 
or addictive behaviour syndrome) or the effects of a medication or substance, including 
withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with personality disorder and personality difficulty
Establishing the presence of a potentially explanatory medical condition that can cause personality 
change and the temporal relationship between the medical condition and the personality change 
is critical in diagnosing secondary personality change. Personality is relatively stable over time, 
and personality disorder and personality difficulty are usually evident by early adulthood. In 
contrast, secondary personality change has its onset following or coincident with the onset of a 
medical condition that is judged to be its direct pathophysiological cause, and is characterized 
by the emergence of personality traits that represent a change from the individual’s previous 
characteristic personality pattern (e.g. marked apathy, indifference, suspiciousness, paranoid 
ideation, disinhibition).
Boundary with dementia
Personality change can occur in the context of dementia, which is characterized by a decline from 
a previous level of cognitive functioning with impairment in two or more cognitive domains (e.g. 
memory, executive functions, attention, language, social cognition and judgement, psychomotor 
speed, visuoperceptual or visuospatial abilities). In secondary personality change, the emergence of 
personality traits that represent a change from the individual’s previous characteristic personality 
pattern is not accompanied by marked cognitive impairment. The emergence of problematic 
personality features in the context of dementia may be recorded using one of the behavioural or 
psychological disturbances in dementia specifiers (e.g. apathy in dementia, agitation or aggression 
in dementia, disinhibition in dementia), if applicable. If the personality changes are judged to 
be due to the same medical condition as is causing the dementia, an additional diagnosis of 
secondary personality change is not warranted.
Boundary with personality change caused by substances or medications, including 
withdrawal effects
When establishing a diagnosis of secondary personality change, it is also important to rule out 
the possibility that a substance or medication is causing the personality disturbance instead of 
– or in addition to – an underlying medical condition. This involves first considering whether 
any of the medications being used to treat the medical condition are known to cause personality 
disturbance at the dose and duration at which it has been administered (e.g. apathy due to chronic 
cannabis use, paranoid ideation due to chronic stimulant use). Second, a temporal relationship 
between the medication use and the onset of the personality disturbance should be established 
(i.e. the personality change began after administration of the medication and/or remitted once the 
medication was discontinued). If the intensity or duration of the personality change is substantially 
in excess of symptoms that are characteristic of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal 
syndrome, then other disorder due to use of substances is the appropriate diagnosis, applying the 
appropriate category corresponding to the substance involved.
Boundary with secondary impulse control or addictive behaviour syndrome
Personality changes may include symptoms of disordered impulse control or addictive behaviours. 
If the personality changes judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition are restricted to increased impulsivity or addictive behaviours, then secondary 
impulse control or addictive behaviour syndrome is the appropriate diagnosis rather secondary 
personality change.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Potentially explanatory medical conditions (examples)
Brain disorders and general medical conditions that have been shown to be capable of producing 
personality change include:
•	 diseases of the nervous system (e.g. encephalitis, Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, 
seizures, stroke);
•	 certain infectious or parasitic diseases (e.g. HIV disease);
•	 endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases (e.g. hypo- and hyperadrenalism, hypo- and 
hyperthyroidism);
•	 injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes (e.g. brain injury).
Secondary catatonia syndrome
See the section on catatonia (p. 201) for the complete CDDR for secondary catatonia syndrome.
Other specified secondary mental or behavioural syndrome
•	 The presence of prominent symptoms that are characteristic of those seen in mental 
disorders but are not adequately captured by any of the other available categories in the 
grouping of secondary mental or behavioural syndromes associated with disorders and 
diseases classified elsewhere, is required for diagnosis.
•	 The symptoms are judged to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical 
condition, based on evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings. 
This judgement depends on establishing the following.
•	 The medical condition is known to be capable of producing the symptoms.
•	 The course of the symptoms (e.g. onset, remission, response to treatment of the etiological 
medical condition) is consistent with causation by the medical condition.
•	 The symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder or the effects of 
a medication or substance, including withdrawal effects.
•	 The symptoms are sufficiently severe to be a specific focus of clinical attention.

Mental or behavioural symptoms, signs or clinical findings
Mental or behavioural 
symptoms, signs or 
clinical findings
Symptoms, signs or clinical findings involving 
consciousness
This section comprises mental or behavioural symptoms that may be an important aspect of an 
individual’s clinical presentation, or may be a reason for a clinical encounter or for treatment. It 
replicates one section of Chapter 21 on symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified.
These categories may be used when a more precise diagnosis has not been established for various 
reasons (e.g. they describe transient symptoms at the time of initial encounter whose causes could 
not be determined; the individual was referred for investigation or treatment before a diagnosis 
was made; the patient failed to return for further investigation or follow-up; a more specific 
diagnosis could not be determined even after investigation). In these cases, the categories from 
this section can be used to describe the clinical presentation in the absence of a diagnosis for the 
underlying disorder or condition.
These categories may also be used to describe clinically important aspects of the individual’s 
presentation when a mental disorder diagnosis has been assigned. They may be especially 
useful when the symptom being described has implications for treatment but is not an essential 
feature of the disorder itself, and does not meet the requirements for another diagnosable 
disorder (e.g. duration, severity, situational specificity). For example, an individual with autism 
spectrum disorder may be experiencing significant anxiety related to a transition to an unfamiliar 
environment that does not by itself meet the diagnostic requirements for any anxiety or fear-
related disorder. In this case, the symptom category MB24.3 Anxiety could be assigned together 
with the diagnosis 6A02 Autism spectrum disorder. (The resulting diagnostic code would be 
6A02/MB24.3.) Thus, additional symptom codes may be used together with the underlying 
diagnosis if they convey clinically important additional information.
Symptom categories should not be applied in circumstances where they do not convey any 
additional meaningful information. For example, applying the symptom code MB24.3 Anxiety 
together with a diagnosis of 6B00 Generalized anxiety disorder would be redundant because 
anxiety is an essential feature of the disorder itself.

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Relationship problems 
and maltreatment
Intimate partner and caregiver–child bonds are among the most important factors affecting 
human health. Threats to these bonds, through acts (e.g. physical maltreatment) or omissions 
(e.g. neglect), significantly affect physical, mental and social well-being. Mental disorders and 
other medical conditions can cause, be caused by, exacerbate or be exacerbated by relationship 
problems or maltreatment. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of relationship problems and 
maltreatment is important for appropriate treatment planning and care. The coding rules for 
relationship problems or maltreatment in ICD-11 are complex, and are therefore presented 
separately in this section.
Different categories from Chapter 23 on external causes of morbidity or mortality and 
Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status or contact with health services are used to 
indicate the presence of relationship problems or maltreatment, depending on the purpose of 
the assessment and the point in time relative to the assessment that maltreatment has occurred 
or is suspected. Maltreatment is an umbrella term that comprises physical abuse, sexual abuse, 
psychological abuse and neglect. All categories are applied to the victim of the maltreatment, 
not to the perpetrator. In cases of mutual relationship distress or maltreatment where both 
parties in a dyad are being evaluated, the categories may be applied to both. Because relationship 
distress and different forms of maltreatment (physical, sexual, psychological or neglect) can co-
occur, as many of these categories may be assigned together as necessary to describe the relevant 
clinical phenomena.
ICD-11 uses consistent definitions of maltreatment across these 
different sets of categories.
•	 Physical abuse (also called physical maltreatment) is defined as non-accidental acts of 
physical force that result – or have reasonable potential to result – in physical harm, or 
that evoke significant fear.
•	 Sexual abuse (also called sexual maltreatment) is defined in adults as forced or coerced 
sexual acts, or sexual acts with someone who is unable to consent. In children, it is defined 
as sexual acts involving a child that are intended to provide sexual gratification to an adult.
•	 Psychological abuse (also called psychological maltreatment) is defined as non-accidental 
verbal or symbolic acts that result in significant psychological harm.
•	 Neglect is defined as egregious acts or omissions by a caregiver that deprive a child, or an 
adult who is incapable of self-care, of needed age-appropriate care, and that result – or 
have reasonable potential to result – in physical or psychological harm.
Relationship problems and maltreatment 

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Maltreatment as a cause of injury or death
Categories for maltreatment from Chapter 23 on external causes of morbidity or mortality 
are used when the purpose is to document the cause of an injury being treated or the cause of 
death. These categories are used along with a classification of the associated physical injury (e.g. 
fracture of nasal bones, burns of external body surface). Available maltreatment categories in 
Chapter 23 include:
Physical maltreatment
Sexual maltreatment
Psychological maltreatment
Other specified maltreatment
Maltreatment, unspecified
Unintentional neglect
Assault by neglect
Neglect with undetermined intent.
The associated injury from Chapter 22 on injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of 
external causes is postcoordinated with the type of maltreatment presumed to have caused it.
Mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder 
and recurrent depressive disorder can clearly be the result of or be exacerbated by maltreatment, 
but they are not typically considered immediate causes of the types of injuries classified in 
Chapter 22. However, mental disorders are provided as postcoordination options for PJ22 
Psychological maltreatment. For other maltreatment categories in Chapter 23, any applicable 
mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis should be assigned separately.
Additional dimensions of the maltreatment as a cause of injury can also be specified via 
postcoordination. These include activity when injured (e.g. paid work, educational activity), 
place of occurrence (e.g. home, school, education area), the perpetrator–victim relationship (e.g. 
spouse or partner, parent, stranger) and the gender of the perpetrator.
As an illustration, below is a fully postcoordinated example of a Chapter 23 maltreatment code:
•	 PJ20 Physical maltreatment
•	 Associated with: NA02.3 Fracture of skull or facial bones
•	 Activity when injured: XE9ME Unpaid cleaning, cooking or maintenance at own place 
of residence
•	 Place of occurrence: XE266 Home
•	 Perpetrator–victim relationship: XE454 Spouse or partner
•	 Gender of perpetrator, male: XE5YG
•	 Context of assault and maltreatment: XE0UM Altercation
The full postcoordinated code is: PJ20&XE9ME&XE266&XE454&XE5YG&XE0UM/NA02.3.

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Relationship problems and maltreatment as factors 
influencing health status or contact with health services
Categories for relationship problems and maltreatment from Chapter 24 on factors influencing 
health status or contact with health services are used when the purpose is to record one of three 
types of clinically significant relationship phenomena. These are:
•	 to document a pattern of clinically significant relationship conflict with an intimate 
partner, parent or other caregiver;
•	 to document a history over the individual’s lifetime of maltreatment independent of 
a specific injury or other harm, which may refer to ongoing maltreatment or to past 
episodes – such as a history of child abuse – that are relevant to the individual’s health 
status or encounters with the health system; or
•	 to document a possible episode of maltreatment that is currently under clinical investigation.
QE51.0 
Relationship problems and maltreatment 
P
Relationship distress with spouse or partner
Relationship distress with spouse or partner is defined as substantial and 
sustained dissatisfaction with a spouse or intimate partner associated with 
significant disturbance in functioning. This diagnosis can be assigned to one or 
both parties in a dyad, depending on the context of the evaluation or treatment.
Caregiver–child relationship problem
Caregiver–child relationship problem is defined as substantial and sustained 
dissatisfaction within a caregiver–child relationship, including a parental 
relationship, associated with significant disturbance in functioning. This 
diagnosis can be assigned to one or both parties in a dyad, depending on the 
context of the evaluation or treatment.
QE52.0 
Available categories for history of maltreatment in Chapter 24 are:
History of spouse or partner violence
QE51.10 	
History of spouse or partner violence, physical
QE51.11 	
History of spouse or partner violence, psychological
QE51.12 	
History of spouse or partner violence, sexual
QE51.13 	
History of spouse or partner violence, neglect.
These diagnoses can be used to indicate ongoing or past episodes of maltreatment 
by a spouse or partner when the focus of the evaluation is not related to a specific 
injury or death. If the history of maltreatment is not related to a spouse or partner 
relationship, categories from QE82 Personal history of maltreatment should be 
used instead.
QE51.1 
Available categories for intimate partner or caregiver–child 
relationship distress or conflict in Chapter 24 are:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Available categories for examination or observation for suspected 
maltreatment in Chapter 24 are:
Relationship problems and maltreatment | Personal history of maltreatment  
Personal history of maltreatment
QE82.0 	
Personal history of physical abuse
QE82.1 	
Personal history of sexual abuse
QE82.2 	
Personal history of psychological abuse
QE82.3 	
Personal history of neglect
QE82.Y 	
Other specified personal history of maltreatment
QE82.Z 	
Personal history of maltreatment, unspecified.
These diagnoses can be used to indicate ongoing or past episodes of maltreatment 
by someone other than a spouse or partner (e.g. a parent, another relative, a 
stranger), when the focus of the evaluation is not related to a specific injury or 
death. If the history of maltreatment is related to a spouse or partner relationship, 
categories from QE51.1 History of spouse or partner violence should be used 
instead. The time in life (e.g. child under 5 years, adolescent, late geriatric) can be 
indicated using postcoordinated extension codes.
QE82 
Examination or observation for suspected maltreatment
QA04.50 	
Examination or observation for suspected physical 
maltreatment
QA04.51 	
Examination or observation for suspected sexual 
maltreatment
QA04.52 	
Examination or observation for suspected psychological 
maltreatment
QA04.53 	
Examination or observation for suspected neglect or 
abandonment
QA04.5Y 	
Other specified examination or observation for suspected 
maltreatment
QA04.5Z 	
Examination or observation for suspected maltreatment, 
unspecified.
QA04.5 
If maltreatment is confirmed based on the examination or observation, the diagnosis should 
generally be changed to one of the maltreatment categories in Chapter 24, if the evaluation is in 
relation to a specific injury, or otherwise to the applicable history or spouse or partner violence or 
personal history of maltreatment category in Chapter 24. 
In some circumstances, categories from Chapter 23 and Chapter 24 can be used together – for 
example, when there is an established history of maltreatment, and an injury resulting from that 
maltreatment is the focus of a current episode of care. However, examination or observation 
codes in Chapter 24 would typically not be assigned together with maltreatment categories from 
Chapter 23 explaining the cause of a specific injury. 

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Relationship problems and maltreatment | Personal history of maltreatment 
As an illustration, below is a postcoordinated example of a Chapter 23 maltreatment code: 
•	
QE82.1 Personal history of sexual abuse
•	
Time in life: XT7Q Early adolescence.
The postcoordinated code is: QE82.1&XT7Q. 
(See discussion of ICD-11 diagnostic coding, p. 30, in the introductory section on using the 
CDDR for ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders.)
CDDR for common forms of relationship problems 
and maltreatment
Because of their importance and prevalence, CDDR have been developed for two sets 
of phenomena:
•	 relationship distress and current or past maltreatment by spouse or partner;
•	 problems in relationship between child and current or former caregiver, and current or 
past child maltreatment.
These are among the most clinically important and impactful forms of relationship problems and 
maltreatment. The CDDR for these two groupings should be applied as appropriate in the context 
of the ICD-11 coding options for relationship problems and maltreatment. For example, physical 
abuse by an intimate partner could be classified as PJ20 Physical maltreatment from Chapter 23 
or QE51.1 History of spouse or partner violence from Chapter 24, depending on the purpose of 
the assessment and nature of the situation.
Relationship distress and current or past maltreatment by 
spouse or partner
This section provides CDDR for the following categories:
•	 to document the cause of an injury being treated or the cause of death:
PJ20 Physical maltreatment, spouse or partner
PJ21 Sexual maltreatment, spouse or partner
PJ22 Psychological maltreatment, spouse of partner
PF1B Assault by neglect
•	 to document a pattern of either a clinically significant relationship conflict with a spouse 
or intimate partner, or a history of intimate partner maltreatment – including ongoing or 
past episodes – as factors that are relevant to the individual’s health status and encounters 
with health services rather than in relationship to a specific injury or death:

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

QE51.0 Relationship distress with spouse or partner
QE51.1 History of spouse or partner violence
QE51.10 History of spouse or partner violence, physical
QE51.12 History of spouse or partner violence, sexual
QE51.11 History of spouse or partner violence, psychological
QE51.13 History of spouse or partner violence, neglect.
Relationship distress with spouse or partner and different forms of intimate partner maltreatment 
can co-occur. As many of the categories in this section may be assigned together as necessary to 
describe the relevant clinical phenomena.
General cultural considerations for relationship distress and maltreatment by 
spouse or partner
•	 Presentations of relationship distress vary, depending on cultural constraints on their 
expression. In some cultures, women may be more attentive to relationship problems and 
therefore more likely report relationship distress.
•	 The prevalence of the different forms of spouse or partner maltreatment (e.g. physical, 
sexual, psychological) vary widely by country, based on the social acceptance, detection 
and consequences of abusive behaviours.
General sex- and/or gender-related features for relationship distress and 
maltreatment by spouse or partner
•	 Although men and women are both affected by relationship distress, women’s health may 
be more influenced by relationship distress, whereas men’s health may be more influenced 
by relationship status (i.e. being in an intimate partner relationship or not).
•	 Gender differences are country- and culture-specific. Overall, women are at much higher 
risk of victimization by maltreatment by their spouses or intimate partners.
Relationship distress with spouse or partner
Essential (required) features
•	 Substantial and sustained dissatisfaction with the intimate relationship (e.g. pervasive 
unhappiness with the relationship, significant thoughts of divorce/separation) is required 
for diagnosis.
•	 The dissatisfaction is associated with disturbance in at least one major area of functioning 
such as:
•	 behaviour (e.g. persistent and intense conflicts, pervasive withdrawal or neglect, lack of 
positive behaviours);

Relationship problems and maltreatment
•	 cognition (e.g. pervasive negative attributions of partner’s intent);
•	 emotion (e.g. persistent and intense anger, sadness or apathy);
•	 physical health (e.g. pain and other physical symptoms not fully explained by a medical 
condition);
•	 interpersonal interaction (e.g. social isolation, decreased involvement in social activities);
•	 major life role activities (e.g. work, school, caregiving).
Note: this category is assigned to the individual being evaluated. In situations in which a couple 
is being evaluated, it may be assigned to both parties if applicable.
Additional clinical features
•	 Relationship distress with spouse or partner is associated with increased risk of various 
mental disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, disorders 
due to substance use), and risk of exacerbation of existing medical conditions.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Occasional relationship dissatisfaction and disagreements occur in most relationships. 
Relationship distress with a spouse or partner should only be assigned when relationship 
dissatisfaction or conflict is a pervasive pattern affecting the individual’s functioning in at 
least one major area.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with spouse or partner maltreatment (physical, psychological, sexual, 
or neglect)
Relationship distress with spouse or partner is not considered a form of maltreatment. However, 
if all diagnostic requirements are met for both relationship distress with spouse or partner and a 
maltreatment category, both may be assigned.
Relationship problems and maltreatment | Relationship distress and current or past maltreatment by spouse or partner

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Physical maltreatment, spouse or partner, or history of spouse or 
partner violence, physical
Essential (required) features
•	 At least one non-accidental act of physical force (e.g. pushing or shoving, scratching, 
slapping, throwing something that could cause injury, punching, biting) is required for 
diagnosis.
•	 The act causes (or exacerbates) at least one of the following:
•	 any physical injury;
•	 significant fear;
•	 reasonable potential for significant physical injury.
•	 The act was not for physical protection of the individual (e.g. to ward off a partner’s 
punches) or partner (e.g. to prevent a partner from attempting suicide).
Note: these categories are assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator. In cases of mutual violence 
in which the couple is being evaluated, they may be assigned to both parties if applicable.
If PJ20 Physical maltreatment is diagnosed, the perpetrator should be specified as a spouse or 
partner using the extension code XE454 (PJ20&XE454). On the ICD-11 platform, the option to 
specify the perpetrator–victim relationship appears in the context of the assault field.
Additional clinical features
•	 Intimate partner physical abuse is, by definition, associated with an increased risk of 
physical injury and need for medical attention.
•	 Intimate partner physical abuse is associated with an increased risk of poor physical health 
and the development of a chronic disease.
•	 Intimate partner physical abuse is associated with higher rates of depressive disorders, 
post-traumatic stress disorder and disorders due to substance use, as well as suicidality.
•	 A pattern of recurrent acts, or the intent to assert control or power, are not required features 
for assigning a diagnosis of intimate partner physical abuse. The diagnosis only requires at 
least one act of violence that causes or exacerbates at least one negative impact.
•	 Most children (i.e. approximately 75%) living in households with clinically significant 
intimate partner physical abuse witness it. Exposure to parental or caregiver intimate 
partner violence places children at significantly greater risk of a range of mental disorders, 
negative affect/distress and negative cognitions, as well as social and academic difficulties.

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Acts of physical aggression (e.g. grabbing a partner’s arm) that do not cause injury or 
significant fear are relatively common in intimate relationships. In contrast, the acts of 
physical violence and associated impacts characteristic of intimate partner physical abuse 
are not part of healthy functioning relationships.
Course features
•	 Intimate partner physical abuse may lessen and remit over time. However, for many 
affected relationships, intimate partner physical abuse reoccurs and sometimes increases 
in frequency or severity.
•	 The risk of intimate partner physical abuse increases in the context of external stressors 
(e.g. job loss) or when the victim is disabled.
Developmental presentations
•	 In general, adolescents and young adults are at greater risk of being victims of intimate 
partner physical abuse because the rate of physically violent acts against intimate partners 
among perpetrators tends to decrease across the lifespan.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with relationship distress with spouse or partner
Intimate partner physical abuse may be, but is not always, associated with relationship distress 
with spouse or partner. If all diagnostic requirements are met for both relationship distress

Sexual maltreatment, spouse or partner, or history of spouse or 
partner violence, sexual
Essential (required) features
•	 At least one of the following acts is required for diagnosis:
•	 the use of physical force to compel participation in a sex act against the partner’s will, or 
when the partner is incapable of consent (whether or not the act is completed);
•	 the use of physical or psychological aggression to coerce the partner to participate in a 
sex act.
•	 The act is against the expressed wishes of the partner.
•	 The act causes significant distress to the partner.
Note: these categories are assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PJ21 Sexual maltreatment is diagnosed, the perpetrator should be specified as a spouse or 
partner using the extension code XE454 (PJ21&XE454). On the ICD-11 platform, the option to 
specify the perpetrator–victim relationship appears in the context of the assault field.
Additional clinical features
•	 Intimate partner sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of physical injury and 
need for medical attention.
•	 Intimate partner sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of poor physical health 
and of development of a chronic disease.
•	 Intimate partner sexual abuse is associated with increased risk of various mental disorders 
(e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, disorders due to substance 
use), as well as suicidality.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Sexual violation and coercion are not part of healthy functioning relationships.

partner sexual abuse because the rate of sexually abusive acts among perpetrators tends to 
decrease across the lifespan.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with relationship distress with spouse or partner
Intimate partner sexual abuse may be, but is not always, associated with relationship distress with 
spouse or partner. If all diagnostic requirements are met for both relationship distress with spouse 
or partner and maltreatment or history of spouse or partner violence, both may be assigned.
Psychological maltreatment, spouse or partner, or history of spouse 
or partner violence, psychological
Essential (required) features
•	 Verbal or symbolic acts with the potential to cause psychological harm to the victim are 
required for diagnosis, such as:
•	 berating, disparaging, degrading, humiliating the partner;
•	 interrogating the partner;
•	 restricting the partner’s ability to come and go freely;
•	 obstructing the partner’s access to assistance (e.g. police aid, legal help, protective 
resources, medical resources, mental health resources);
•	 threatening the partner;
•	 harming, or threatening to harm, people/things that the partner cares about;
•	 restricting the partner’s access to or use of economic resources;
•	 isolating the partner from family, friends or social support resources;
•	 stalking the partner;
•	 trying to make people think that the partner is “crazy”, including for suggesting that they 
are a victim of psychological maltreatment.
•	 The acts cause (or exacerbate) at least one of the following:
•	 significant fear;
•	 significant psychological distress;
•	 somatic symptoms that interfere with normal functioning;

•	 significant self-imposed restrictions in engaging in one or more major life activities (e.g. 
work, education, religion, medical or mental services, contact with family members) to 
avoid recurrence of the acts.
Note: these categories are assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PJ22 Psychological maltreatment is diagnosed, the perpetrator should be specified as a spouse 
or partner using the extension code XE454 (PJ22&XE454). On the ICD-11 platform, the option 
to specify the perpetrator–victim relationship appears in the context of the assault field.
Additional clinical features
•	 Intimate partner psychological abuse typically represents a pattern of behaviours. However, 
it may be diagnosed based on a single episode if it is sufficiently impactful (e.g. harming a 
pet to punish the partner).
•	 Intimate partner psychological abuse at a clinically significant level is associated with 
increased risk of seeking medical attention, as well as an increased risk of poor health and 
of development of a chronic disease.
•	 Intimate partner psychological abuse is associated with higher rates of depressive disorders, 
post-traumatic stress disorder and disorders due to substance use, as well as suicidality.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Acts of psychological aggression (e.g. disparaging one’s partner) that do not cause 
significant distress are relatively common in intimate relationships. In contrast, the 
verbal and symbolic acts and their associated impacts that constitute intimate partner 
psychological abuse are not characteristic of healthy functioning relationships.
Course features
•	 Intimate partner psychological abuse commonly emerges in adolescence and early 
adulthood, but is prevalent across the lifespan.
•	 The risk of intimate partner psychological abuse increases in the context of external 
stressors (e.g. job loss).

Intimate partner psychological abuse may be, but is not always, associated with relationship 
distress with spouse or partner. If all diagnostic requirements are met for both relationship 
distress with spouse or partner and maltreatment or history of spouse or partner violence, both 
may be assigned.
Assault by neglect or history of spouse or partner violence, 
neglect
Essential (required) features
•	 At least one egregious act or omission by an adult’s caregiver that deprives an intimate 
partner who is incapable of self-care of needed or adequate food, shelter, hygiene or 
necessary services is required for diagnosis. Examples of self-care incapacity include 
physical, psychological, intellectual and cultural (e.g. inability to manage activities of 
rudimentary daily living due to living in a foreign culture) limitations.
•	 The act or omission causes significant physical injury or other significant negative 
consequences to health (e.g. development of an illness directly linked to the neglect, 
malnutrition) or reasonable potential for significant injury or negative consequences 
to health.
Note: this category is assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PF1B Assault by neglect is diagnosed, the perpetrator should be specified as a spouse or partner 
using the extension code XE454 (PF1B&XE454). On the ICD-11 platform, the option to specify 
the perpetrator–victim relationship appears in the context of the assault field. Depending on the 
specific situation, PB5B Unintentional neglect or PH7B Neglect with undetermined intent may 
be diagnosed rather than PF1B Assault by neglect.
Additional clinical features
•	 Neglect at a clinically significant level is associated with increased risk of various mental 
disorders (e.g. depressive disorders, anxiety and fear-related disorders, post-traumatic 
stress disorder), suicidality and various medical conditions (e.g. bed sores, malnutrition).

•	 Small lapses in caregiving to partners who are incapable of self-care are common, and 
a diagnosis of history of spouse or partner violence, neglect, should not be assigned on 
this basis. In contrast, egregious acts or omissions that cause significant physical injury or 
reasonable potential for such injury much less common and, if all diagnostic requirements 
are met, warrant the diagnosis.
Problems in relationship between child and current or 
former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

•	 to document the cause of an injury being treated or the cause of death:
PJ20 Physical maltreatment of a child
PJ21 Sexual maltreatment of a child
PJ22 Psychological maltreatment of a child
PF1B Assault by neglect
•	 to document a pattern of either a clinically significant relationship conflict in the relationship 
of a child with a current or former caregiver, or a history of child maltreatment – including 
ongoing or past episodes – as factors that are relevant to the individual’s health status and 
encounters with health services rather than in relationship to a specific injury or death:

relevant clinical phenomena.
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Caregiver–child relationship problem
Essential (required) features
•	 Substantial and sustained dissatisfaction with the caregiver–child relationship (including 
adolescents) is required for diagnosis; this may be manifested in:
•	 a pervasive sense of unhappiness with the relationship;
•	 for the child, repeated running away, persistent thoughts of running away or fantasies of 
having another caregiver;
•	 for the caregiver, wishing the child were totally different or had not been born, or thoughts 
of relinquishing care of the child;
•	 the child allying themselves strongly with one parent and rejecting a relationship with the 
other parent, without evidence of maltreatment by the rejected parent – this primarily 
occurs in the context of a high-conflict relationship between two parents, including 
separation or divorce.
•	 The dissatisfaction is associated with disturbance in at least one major area of functioning, 
such as the following:
•	 behaviour (e.g. persistent and intense conflicts, pervasive withdrawal or neglect; lack of 
positive behaviours; failure to socialize child through nonexistent or poorly enforced 
limits; poor monitoring of the child’s activities; overinvolvement in child’s activities; 
child concealment of activities; child’s persistent rejection, denigration and criticism of 
the caregiver);
•	 cognition (e.g. pervasive negative attributions of caregiver or child intent);
•	 emotion (e.g. persistent and intense anger, contempt, sadness or apathy);
•	 physical health (i.e. exacerbation of medical or psychological symptoms or significant 
interference with provision of medical or psychological care);
•	 interpersonal interaction (e.g. social isolation, decreased involvement in social activities);
•	 major life role activities (e.g. work, school, caregiving).
Note: behaviours associated with each area will vary according to the developmental stage of 
the child or adolescent, as well as the cultural context. This category should only be considered 
as applicable within a child or adolescent’s primary caregiving relationships, which may include 
relationships with parents, grandparents or other significant long-term caregivers. This category 
may be assigned to either the child or the caregiver, depending on who is being evaluated. 
In situations in which a caregiver–child dyad is being evaluated, substantial and sustained 
relationship dissatisfaction, if present, is commonly – although not always – experienced by both 
parties. The diagnosis may be assigned to both parties if applicable.
Additional clinical features
•	 Problems in caregiver–child relationships are associated with the development of 
oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder.
QE52.0 
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Temporary fluctuations in parenting behaviours due to stress or illness are common. For 
example, a parent undergoing serious medical treatment may be unable temporarily to 
meet a child’s needs appropriately. Similarly, more focused conflicts with caregivers are 
common among adolescents. Caregiver–child relationship problem should only be 
assigned if the relationship distress is substantial and sustained, and affects functioning.
Course features
•	 Caregiver–child relationship problem has a variable course. In some cases, relationship 
distress has a chronic course; in other cases, it may show substantial improvement over time.
Developmental presentations
•	 Young children are more likely to present with attachment problems (insecure or 
disorganized patterns), difficulty separating from parents or caregivers, or physical 
complaints than psychological symptoms. Psychological symptoms are more likely among 
older children and adolescents.
•	 In infants or young children, distress may be exhibited by persistent withdrawal from the 
caregiver, freezing behaviours or heightened reactivity around the caregiver. Significant 
impact may be evidenced by a lack of appropriate developmental progression or even a loss 
of skills in an infant or young child.
•	 For children or teens, distress may be exhibited by physical aggression, poor cooperation 
or oppositional behaviour with the affected caregiver, or by refusal to interact with the 
affected caregiver.
•	 Older caregivers, such as grandparents, may be more vulnerable to problems in their 
relationships with high-energy children.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although both the nature of the parental acts and their impact can vary by gender, boys 
and girls are equally likely to experience a caregiver–child relationship problem.
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with child maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological 
abuse, neglect)
Caregiver–child relationship problem includes parenting behaviours that are within the normal 
range given the sociocultural context but that nonetheless have a negative impact on the child. 
Some caregiving behaviours may be appropriate for many children, but not for the specific child. 
These caregiver behaviours do not meet the diagnostic requirements for any child maltreatment 
category. In contrast, in child psychological maltreatment, one or more verbal or symbolic acts 
of parenting are clearly outside cultural norms, and are – or have reasonable potential to be – 
harmful to the child. If diagnostic requirements for both caregiver–child relationship problem 
and a form of child maltreatment are met, both may be assigned.
Boundary with oppositional defiant disorder
Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a pattern of markedly noncompliant, defiant 
and disobedient disruptive behaviour that is not typical for individuals of comparable age and 
developmental level. Similar behaviours may be observed in the context of caregiver–child 
relationship problem, but these are often confined to the specific caregiver–child relationship. 
In addition, in caregiver–child relationship problem there is often evidence that caregiver 
behaviours are not optimal for the child. However, if diagnostic requirements for both caregiver–
child relationship problem and oppositional defiant disorder are met, both may be assigned.
Boundary with reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement 
disorder
Reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder are characterized by 
a history of grossly insufficient care associated with markedly abnormal attachment behaviours 
exhibited towards adult caregivers, with onset prior to the age of 5 years. Similar abnormal 
attachment behaviours may be observed in caregiver–child relationship problem. However, if 
all diagnostic requirements for reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited social engagement 
disorder are met, a diagnosis of caregiver–child relationship problem is typically not warranted.
Physical maltreatment of child or personal history of physical abuse 
as a child
Essential (required) features
•	 At least one non-accidental act of physical force (e.g. pushing or shoving, slapping, 
punching, throwing something that could cause injury) towards a child or adolescent is 
required for diagnosis.
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment
PJ20 / 
QE82.0

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 The act causes (or exacerbates) at least one of the following:
•	 any physical injury (e.g. bruises, cuts, sprains, broken bones, loss of consciousness, pain 
that lasts for several hours);
•	 significant fear;
•	 reasonable potential for significant physical injury.
•	 The act was not committed for physical self-protection (e.g. to ward off an adolescent’s 
punches) or to protect the child or adolescent (e.g. to prevent a small child from running 
into a busy street or to prevent an adolescent from attempting suicide).
Note: these categories are assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PJ20 Physical maltreatment is diagnosed, the perpetrator–victim relationship (e.g. parent, 
other relative, stranger) should be specified using the extension codes provided on the ICD-11 
platform in the context of the assault field. Similarly, if QE82.0 Personal history of physical abuse 
is diagnosed, the time of life for current or past episodes (e.g. child aged under 5 years, early 
adolescence) can be specified using the extension codes provided.
Additional clinical features
•	 Physical abuse of a child or adolescent can occur as an isolated incident. However, it can also 
occur as a pattern of parental or caregiver behaviour. If identified in a child or adolescent, it 
is important to evaluate whether past injuries were due to child physical abuse.
•	 There are numerous injury types that when presented in a child are likely to have been 
caused by physical abuse. These include classic metaphyseal lesion (bucket handle fracture 
of the long bone); femur – metaphyseal and spiral fractures; humerus – metaphyseal and 
spiral fractures; rib fractures; spinous process fracture; skull – diastatic, across suture 
lines; subdural/epidural injury; patterned burns; patterned bruising; retinal haemorrhage 
(bilateral, multilayer). Many other injuries may also be caused by physical abuse of a child.
•	 Child physical abuse is associated with a variety of mental disorders, including depressive 
disorders, adjustment disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder, as well as attentional 
problems, academic problems and suicidality.
•	 Among younger children, disturbances in attachment, difficulty separating from parents 
or caregivers and vague physical complaints (stomach pain, headache) are more common 
results of physical abuse than psychological symptoms.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Physical discipline (e.g. spanking following perceived negative behaviours of the child) 
does not necessarily meet the diagnostic requirements for child physical abuse. Physical 
discipline is differentiated from child physical abuse by its impact. If physical discipline 
results in injury, has a reasonable potential for causing physical injury or elicits significant 
fear, a diagnosis of child physical abuse may be warranted.
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Developmental presentations
•	 For infants or young children, distress associated with physical abuse may be exhibited 
by persistent withdrawal from the caregiver, freezing behaviours or heightened reactivity 
around the caregiver. The child may also exhibit an insecure or disorganized pattern of 
attachment. A significant impact of physical abuse may be evidenced by lack of appropriate 
developmental progression or even a loss of skills in infant or young child. Vague physical 
complaints (stomach pain, headache) are also common.
•	 Symptoms of mental disorders are more likely among older children and adolescents who 
experience physical abuse. Distress may also be manifested in physical aggression, poor 
cooperation or oppositional behaviour towards the relevant caregiver; refusal to interact 
with that caregiver; thoughts of running away or fantasies of having another caregiver; 
inhibition, withdrawal or low self-esteem.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although the impact of physical abuse can vary by gender (e.g. externalizing versus 
internalizing symptoms), boys and girls are equally likely to be victims.
Sexual maltreatment of child or personal history of sexual abuse 
as child
Essential (required) features
•	 At least one of the following acts involving an adult and a child is required for diagnosis:
•	 physical contact of a sexual nature between child and an adult – for example, vaginal or 
anal penetration (or attempted penetration), oral-genital or oral-anal contact, fondling 
(directly or through clothing);
•	 non-contact exploitation, involving an adult forcing, tricking, enticing, threatening or 
pressuring a child to participate in acts for anyone’s sexual gratification without direct 
physical contact between the child and the perpetrator – for example, exposing a child’s 
genitals, anus or breasts; having a child masturbate or watch masturbation; having a child 
participate in sexual activity with a third person (including child prostitution); having a 
child pose, undress or perform in a sexual fashion (including child pornography).
Note: these categories are assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PJ21 Sexual maltreatment is diagnosed, the perpetrator–victim relationship (e.g. parent, other 
relative, stranger) should be specified using the extension codes provided on the ICD-11 platform 
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

in the context of the assault field. Similarly, if QE82.1 Personal history of sexual abuse is diagnosed, 
the time of life for current or past episodes (e.g. child aged under 5 years, early adolescence) can 
be specified using the extension codes provided.
Additional clinical features
•	 Child sexual abuse is associated with a variety of mental disorders, including depressive 
disorders, adjustment disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder, as well as attentional 
problems, academic problems and suicidality.
•	 Sexual abuse that includes physical contact and penetration can result in genital or anal 
injuries, sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Mutual sex play between age mates is not considered sexual abuse. Sexual activity between 
adolescent partners should not be diagnosed as child sexual abuse.
Developmental presentations
•	 Among younger children who experience sexual abuse, disturbances in attachment 
(insecure or disorganized patterns, difficulty separating from parents or caregivers, and 
vague physical complaints such as stomach pain or headache) are more common than 
psychological symptoms.
•	 Among older children and adolescents, psychological symptoms and externalizing 
behaviours are more common reactions to sexual abuse.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Sexual abuse of girls is generally more common than sexual abuse of boys, although this 
varies by country and culture.
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Psychological maltreatment of child or personal history of 
psychological abuse as child
Essential (required) features
•	 Verbal or symbolic acts with the potential to cause psychological harm to a child or 
adolescent are required for diagnosis. Examples include:
•	 berating, disparaging, degrading, humiliating the child;
•	 threatening the child (e.g. indicating or implying future physical harm, abandonment, 
sexual assault);
•	 harming or abandoning – or threatening to harm or abandon – people or things that the 
child cares about, such as pets, property, loved ones (e.g. exposing a child to spouse or 
partner maltreatment);
•	 confining the child (e.g. typing a child’s arms or legs together; binding a child to a chair, 
bed or other object; confining a child to an small enclosed area such as a closet);
•	 scapegoating the child (i.e. blaming child for things for which they cannot possibly be 
responsible);
•	 coercing the child to inflict pain on themselves;
•	 disciplining the child excessively through physical or non-physical means (e.g. extremely 
high frequency or duration), without necessarily meeting diagnostic requirements for 
physical maltreatment.
•	 The acts cause (or exacerbate) at least one of the following:
•	 significant fear;
•	 significant psychological distress;
•	 somatic symptoms that interfere with normal functioning;
•	 significant avoidance or reluctance to engage in one or more major life activities (e.g. 
work, education, religion, medical or mental services, contact with family members) to 
avoid recurrence of the acts.
Note: these categories are assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PJ22 Psychological maltreatment is diagnosed, the perpetrator–victim relationship (e.g. parent, 
other relative, stranger) should be specified using the extension codes provided on the ICD-11 
platform in the context of the assault field. Similarly, if QE82.2 Personal history of psychological 
abuse is diagnosed, the time of life for current or past episodes (e.g. child aged under 5 years, early 
adolescence) can be specified using the extension codes provided.
Additional clinical features
•	 Child psychological abuse typically represents a pattern of parental or caregiver behaviours. 
However, it may be diagnosed based on single episode if it is sufficiently impactful (e.g. 
harming a pet to punish the child).
PJ22 / 
QE82.2
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

•	 Child psychological abuse is associated with a variety of mental disorders, including 
depressive disorders, adjustment disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, post-
traumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct-dissocial disorder, as 
well as attentional problems, academic problems and suicidality.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Child psychological abuse is characterized by one or more verbal or symbolic acts, generally 
outside the sociocultural norms for parenting, that are – or have reasonable potential to be 
– harmful to the child. In contrast, whereas normal discipline may be upsetting to children, 
unlike psychological maltreatment it does not cause psychological harm, have the potential 
to cause psychological harm, result in somatic symptoms or interfere with functioning.
Developmental presentations
•	 For infants or young children, distress associated with psychological abuse may be 
exhibited by persistent withdrawal from the caregiver, freezing behaviours or heightened 
reactivity around the caregiver. The child may also exhibit an insecure or disorganized 
pattern of attachment. A significant impact of psychological abuse may be evidenced by 
lack of appropriate developmental progression or even a loss of skills in infant or young 
child. Vague physical complaints (stomach pain, headache) are also common.
•	 Symptoms of mental disorders are more likely among older children and adolescents who 
experience psychological abuse. Distress may also be manifested in physical aggression, 
poor cooperation or oppositional behaviour towards the relevant caregiver; refusal to 
interact with that caregiver; thoughts of running away or fantasies of having another 
caregiver; inhibition, withdrawal or low self-esteem.
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although the nature of parental acts (e.g. restriction versus humiliation) and the impact 
of psychological abuse can vary by gender, boys and girls are equally likely to be victims.

Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with caregiver–child relationship problem
Psychological maltreatment should be distinguished from caregiver–child relationship problem, 
which – unlike psychological maltreatment – is characterized by parenting behaviours that are 
within the normal range for the sociocultural context but may still have a negative impact on 
the child.
Assault by neglect or personal history of neglect as a child
Essential (required) features
•	 At least one confirmed or suspected egregious act or omission by a child or adolescent’s 
caregiver that deprives the child of needed age-appropriate care is required for diagnosis 
(e.g. abandonment, lack of appropriate supervision; exposure to physical hazard; failure to 
provide necessary education, health care, nourishment, shelter, clothing).
•	 The act or omission causes or exacerbates at least one of the following impacts:
•	 significant physical injury or reasonable potential for significant injury;
•	 other significant negative consequences to health (e.g. development of an illness directly 
linked to the neglect, malnutrition) or reasonable potential for significant negative 
consequences to health;
•	 significant fear or psychological distress;
•	 reasonable potential for significant psychological harm (e.g. development of a mental 
disorder) or for significant disruption of the child’s physical, psychological, cognitive or 
social development);
•	 somatic symptoms that interfere with normal functioning.
Note: this category is assigned to the victim, not the perpetrator.
If PF1B Assault by neglect is diagnosed, the perpetrator–victim relationship (e.g. parent, other 
relative, stranger) should be specified using the extension codes provided on the ICD-11 platform 
in the context of the assault field. Perpetrator should be specified as a parent, other relative, 
unrelated caregiver, or official or legal authority using the available extension codes. Depending 
on the specific situation, PB5B Unintentional neglect or PH7B Neglect with undetermined intent 
may be diagnosed rather than PF1B Assault by neglect. If QE82.3 Personal history of neglect 
is diagnosed, the time of life for current or past episodes (e.g. child aged under 5 years, early 
adolescence) can be specified using the extension codes provided.

QE82.3
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Additional clinical features
•	 Victims of child neglect can present with severe (chronically untreated) dental caries, ear 
infections or other typical childhood illnesses.
•	 Child neglect is associated with a variety of mental disorders, including depressive 
disorders, adjustment disorder, anxiety and fear-related disorders, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct-dissocial disorder, attentional problems, 
academic problems and suicidality.
Boundary with normality (threshold)
•	 Parents or other caregivers may provide less than optimal care for their children for brief 
periods due to caregiver illness or stress. However, normal caregiving requires that they 
make other arrangements if their own caregiving will be compromised for more than a 
brief period. If a child is in danger, or is suffering significant harm as a result of inadequate 
caregiving, the omissions in caregiving should be diagnosed as neglect.
Developmental presentations
•	 Children of any age can experience neglect. Neglected children may appear mature for 
their age, but may also exhibit stunted growth due to lack of adequate nutrition or other 
developmental deficits.
•	 Failure to meet developmental milestones can be a marker of neglect, as can attachment 
problems (insecure or disorganized patterns), difficulty separating from parents or 
caregivers, social skills deficits, behaviour problems and scholastic problems.
Course features
•	 Although one incident is sufficient to meet the diagnostic requirements, incidents of child 
neglect often occur as part of a persistent pattern, which substantially increases the risk of 
mental disorders, medical conditions and disrupted development.
Problems in relationship between child and current former caregiver and current or past child maltreatment

Relationship problems and maltreatment
Sex- and/or gender-related features
•	 Although its impact can vary by gender, boys and girls are equally likely to be victims 
of neglect.
Boundaries with other disorders and conditions (differential diagnosis)
Boundary with caregiver–child relationship problem
Neglect is characterized by egregious acts or omissions that result in – or have significant potential 
to result in – negative impacts. A diagnosis of caregiver–child relationship problem is generally 
more appropriate for children of caregivers who are emotionally neglectful (e.g. not engaging 
in positive interactions with the child) but have not committed egregious acts or omissions that 
deprive the child or adolescent of age-appropriate care.
Boundary with reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement 
disorder
Both reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder are considered to 
result from a history of grossly insufficient care in early childhood, including persistent disregard 
for the child’s basic emotional or physical needs. They can occur in the context of repeated 
changes of foster care or rearing in institutional settings that prevent the formation of stable 
selective attachments, as well as in dyadic caregiver relationships. The insufficient care would 
meet the diagnostic requirements for neglect and possibly also for other forms of maltreatment. 
Both reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder are characterized 
by markedly abnormal attachment behaviours towards adult caregivers that are evident by the age 
of 5 years. In reactive attachment disorder, there is a persistent and pervasive pattern of inhibited, 
emotionally withdrawn behaviour, including minimal seeking of comfort when distressed and 
rare or minimal response to comfort when it is offered. In disinhibited social engagement disorder, 
there is a persistent and pervasive pattern of markedly abnormal social behaviours, in which 
the child displays reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar 
adults. If the diagnostic requirements are met for reactive attachment disorder or disinhibited 
social engagement disorder, that diagnosis should be assigned. An additional diagnosis of 
assault by neglect or personal history of neglect may be assigned if it is relevant to the particular 
clinical situation.

Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Requirements for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders

Factors influencing health status or contact with health services particularly relevant to mental health services
Factors influencing health 
status or contact with health 
services particularly relevant 
to mental health services
This section includes a selection of categories from Chapter 24 on factors influencing health status 
or contact with health services that may be especially relevant to mental health professionals 
and mental health services, but that do not represent mental disorders or a disease or disorder 
classified elsewhere in ICD-11. This listing is not comprehensive, and other available Chapter 24 
groupings may be relevant.6 This listing is also not intended to suggest that these are the only 
categories from Chapter 24 that should be used by mental health professionals.
One set of categories in Chapter 24 makes it possible to record the reason for a particular 
health service encounter other than a disease, a disorder or a specific symptom. For example, 
QE51.0 Relationship distress with spouse or partner is included in this section and is discussed 
in the section on relationship problems and maltreatment (p. 707). Other examples include 
QE62 Uncomplicated bereavement and QD3Z Concerns about body appearance that do not 
meet the diagnostic requirements for body dysmorphic disorder or another mental disorder. 
These categories can be used on their own without an accompanying disorder diagnosis to describe 
the reason for a health encounter. For example, a person with no mental disorder diagnosis might 
present with QD85 Burnout, a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not 
been successfully managed but that is not considered a mental disorder. These categories can also 
be used in conjunction with a diagnosis from this mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental 
disorders chapter to highlight an issue for other health professionals or for the health system. 
For example, for an individual diagnosed with 6A20.10 Schizophrenia, multiple episodes, 
currently symptomatic, QE70.0 Inadequate family support could also be coded if it is relevant for 
discharge planning. Chapter 24 also includes problems related to health behaviours that do not 
represent diagnosable mental disorders, such as QE10 Hazardous alcohol use or QE23 Problems 
with inappropriate diet or eating habits.
A second set of categories in Chapter 24 are those that document health services involving 
different types of counselling that may be provided to individuals living with a mental disorder 
but also to individuals with no diagnosis. Examples include QA15 Counselling related to sexuality 
and QA18 Family counselling. These can also be considered interventions or procedures, but they 
are included in Chapter 24 because they may represent reasons for a particular health encounter.
A third set of categories in Chapter 24 represent broader factors that influence the person’s 
health status and care but are not mental disorders (e.g. QD71.0 Homelessness). Inclusion of 
this type of category in addition to the diagnosis of a mental disorder can provide important 
contextual information to improve the personalization of care. For example, QE04 Target of 
perceived adverse discrimination or persecution could be coded when the experience of racial 
discrimination is deemed a contributory factor to a depressive disorder. Many of these categories 

 A complete listing can be found at ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11 MMS) [website]. Geneva: World Health 
Organization; 2023 (https://ICD.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/).

relate to recognized social determinants of mental health – that is, risk factors for the development, 
maintenance or moderation of symptoms of mental disorders across the lifespan.
The categories in this list are ordered in a way that is intended to make the list useful to mental 
health professionals and does not correspond entirely to their ordering in ICD-11.7 Not all of the 
categories include brief descriptions or definitions; where they are provided, they are included in 
this section.

parent, illness or birth of a sibling.
Removal from home in childhood
Institutional upbringing
•	 Institutional upbringing refers to group foster care in which parenting responsibilities are 
largely taken over by some form of institution (such as residential nursery, orphanage or 
children’s home), or therapeutic care over a prolonged period in which the child is in a 
hospital, convalescent home or the like, without at least one parent living with the child.
Inappropriate parental pressure or other abnormal qualities of upbringing
•	 Inappropriate parental pressure or other abnormal qualities of upbringing refers to 
parents forcing the child to be different from the local norm – either sex-inappropriate 
(e.g. dressing a boy in girl’s clothes), age-inappropriate (e.g. forcing a child to take on 
responsibilities above their own age) or otherwise inappropriate (e.g. pressing the child to 
engage in unwanted or too difficult activities).

Personality difficulty
See the section on personality disorders and related traits, p. 553.
•	 Personality difficulty refers to pronounced personality characteristics that may affect 
treatment or health services but do not rise to the level of severity to merit a diagnosis 
of personality disorder. Personality difficulty is characterized by longstanding difficulties 
(e.g. at least 2 years) in the individual’s way of experiencing and thinking about the self, 
others and the world. In contrast to personality disorder, these difficulties are manifested 
in cognitive and emotional experience and expression only intermittently (e.g. during 
times of stress) or at low intensity. The difficulties are associated with some problems 
in functioning, but these are insufficiently severe to cause notable disruption in social, 
occupational and interpersonal relationships, or may be limited to specific relationships 
or situations.
Malingering
•	 Malingering is the feigning, intentional production or significant exaggeration of physical 
or psychological symptoms, or intentional misattribution of genuine symptoms to an 
unrelated event or series of events when this is specifically motivated by external incentives 
or rewards such as escaping duty or work, mitigating punishment, obtaining medications 
or drugs, or receiving unmerited recompense such as disability compensation or personal 
injury damages award.
Problems associated with health behaviours
Hazardous substance use

that warrants attention and advice from health professionals. The increased risk may be 
from the frequency of alcohol use, from the amount used on a given occasion, from risky 
behaviours associated with alcohol use or the context of use, or from a combination of 
these. The risk may be related to short-term effects of alcohol or to longer-term cumulative 
effects on physical or mental health or functioning. Hazardous alcohol use has not yet 
reached the level of having caused harm to physical or mental health of the user or others 
around the user. The pattern of alcohol use often persists in spite of awareness of increased 
risk of harm to the user or to others.
Hazardous drug use
•	 Hazardous drug use refers to a pattern of use of psychoactive substances other than 
nicotine or alcohol that appreciably increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health 
consequences – to the user or to others – to an extent that warrants attention and advice 
from health professionals. The increased risk may be from the frequency of substance 
use, from the amount used on a given occasion, from risky behaviours associated with 
substance use or the context of use, from a harmful route of administration, or from a 
combination of these. The risk may be related to short-term effects of the substance or to 
longer-term cumulative effects on physical or mental health or functioning. Hazardous 
drug use has not yet reached the level of having caused harm to physical or mental health 
of the user or others around the user. The pattern of drug use often persists in spite of 
awareness of increased risk of harm to the user or to others.

Hazardous nicotine use
•	 Hazardous nicotine use refers to a pattern of nicotine use that appreciably increases the 
risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences – to the user or to others – to an 
extent that warrants attention and advice from health professionals. Most often nicotine 
is consumed in the form of tobacco, but there are also other forms of nicotine delivery 
(e.g. nicotine vapour). Hazardous nicotine use has not yet reached the level of having 
caused harm to physical or mental health of the user or others around the user. The pattern 
of nicotine use often persists in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the user 
or to others. This category is not intended to include the use of nicotine replacement 
therapies under medical supervision when these are used as part of attempts to stop or 
reduce smoking.

others around this individual. The increased risk may be from the frequency of gambling 
or betting, from the amount of time spent on these activities or the context of gambling or 
betting, from the neglect of other activities and priorities, from risky behaviours associated 
with gambling or betting or its context, from the adverse consequences of gambling or

in spite of awareness of increased risk of harm to the individual or to others.
Hazardous gaming
•	 Hazardous gaming refers to a pattern of gaming, either online or offline that appreciably 
increases the risk of harmful physical or mental health consequences to the individual or 
to others around this individual. The increased risk may be from the frequency of gaming, 
from the amount of time spent on these activities, from the neglect of other activities and 
priorities, from risky behaviours associated with gaming or its context, from the adverse 
consequences of gaming, or from a combination of these. The pattern of gaming often

Crosswalk from ICD-11 mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders to ICD-10 for clinician use
Crosswalk from ICD-11 
mental, behavioural and 
neurodevelopmental disorders 
to ICD-10 for clinician use
This table provides a crosswalk or mapping specifically designed for use by clinicians from 
categories in this ICD-11 chapter on mental, behavioural and neurodevelopmental disorders to 
the nearest equivalent ICD-10 category. This will be useful, for example, in settings where there 
has been a shift to use of ICD-11 for clinical purposes, but where data or health reporting systems 
are still in transition and require the use of ICD-10 codes.
Use of this table assumes that the clinician has already made their diagnosis according to the 
ICD-11 CDDR. This table is not valid for mapping categories from the ICD-10 mental and 
behavioural disorders to ICD-11 because it does not reflect the full content of the ICD-10 mental 
and behavioural disorders.
This crosswalk is not intended for use in health statistics or in the coding of medical records 
because, in a substantial number of instances, selecting among multiple possible ICD-10 
categories depends on clinical information that will not be available in those contexts. Additional 
information to assist clinicians in making these distinctions is provided in the “Notes” column 
on the right.
In the table that follows, the ICD-11 categories are listed in the left column in the order in which 
they appear in the classification. The closest available ICD-10 category to represent that ICD-11 
disorder (i.e. the preferred code) is provided as the first entry in the middle column. Many of these 
are 4-character ICD-10 codes (e.g. F80.1), but in other instances a 3-character code (e.g. F20) or 
a 5-character code (e.g. F10.24) best captures the ICD-11 category. Where ICD-10 5-character 
codes appear, these are taken from The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: 
clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines, which in some cases include more detailed coding 
options than the statistical version of ICD-10.
Data systems and/or reporting requirements in some health systems and countries may require 
that 4-character ICD-10 codes are used if they are available, so that a 3-character code is not 
accepted if a 4-character subcategory exists. Similarly, many data systems do not accept 5-character 
ICD-10 codes, allowing a maximum of 4 characters. In situations in which the nearest equivalent 
ICD-10 category is not a 4-character code, a 4-character coding option is also provided.
Additional coding or reporting requirements vary widely across settings and countries. 
The mappings provided here may therefore require adjustment based on the requirements of the 
specific clinical setting. This crosswalk is not intended to contravene any guidance that may be 
provided by the relevant health system or government.
In a couple of specific instances (e.g. ICD-11 Body dysmorphic disorder), coding information 
provided in The ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders: clinical descriptions and 
diagnostic guidelines is not consistent with current evidence. The mappings provided in the table 
are consistent with the ICD-11 conceptualizations in these cases, with such deviations described 
in the “Notes” column.
